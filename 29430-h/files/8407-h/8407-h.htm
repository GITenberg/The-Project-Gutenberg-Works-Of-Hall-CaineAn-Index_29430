    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 9th of May, 18&mdash;, three persons important to
      this story stood among the passengers on the deck of the Isle of Man
      steamship <i>Tynwald</i> as she lay by the pier at Douglas getting up
      steam for the passage to Liverpool. One of these was an old clergyman of
      seventy, with a sweet, mellow, childlike face; another was a young man of
      thirty, also a clergyman; the third was a girl of twenty. The older
      clergyman wore a white neckcloth about his throat, and was dressed in
      rather threadbare black of a cut that had been more common twenty years
      before; the younger clergyman wore a Roman collar, a long clerical coat,
      and a stiff, broad-brimmed hat with a cord and tassel. They stood
      amidships, and the captain, coming out of his room to mount the bridge,
      saluted them as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young clergyman returned the salutation with a slight bow and the
      lifting of his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning to you, Parson Quayle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old clergyman answered cheerily, &ldquo;Oh, good morning, captain; good
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the usual inquiry about the weather outside, and drawing up to
      answer it, the captain came eye to eye with the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is the granddaughter, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this is Glory,&rdquo; said Parson Quayle. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s leaving the old
      grandfather at last, captain, and I&rsquo;m over from Peel to set her off, you
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the young lady has got the world before her&mdash;at her feet, I
      ought to say.&mdash;You&rsquo;re looking as bright and fresh as the morning,
      Miss Quayle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain carried off his compliment with a breezy laugh, and went along
      to the bridge. The girl had heard him only in a momentary flash of
      consciousness, and she replied merely with a side glance and a smile. Both
      eyes and ears, and every sense and every faculty, seemed occupied with the
      scene before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful spring morning, not yet nine o&rsquo;clock, but the sun stood
      high over Douglas Head, and the sunlight was glancing in the harbour from
      the little waves of the flowing tide. Oars were rattling up the pier,
      passengers were trooping down the gangways, and the decks fore and aft
      were becoming thronged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; she was saying, not so much to her companions as to
      herself, and the old parson was laughing at her bursts of rapture over the
      commonplace scene, and dropping out in reply little driblets of simple
      talk&mdash;sweet, pure nothings&mdash;the innocent babble as of a mountain
      stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was taller than the common, and had golden-red hair, and magnificent
      dark-gray eyes of great size. One of her eyes had a brown spot, which gave
      at the first glance the effect of a squint, at the next glance a
      coquettish expression, and ever after a sense of tremendous power and
      passion. But her most noticeable feature was her mouth, which was somewhat
      too large for beauty, and was always moving nervously. When she spoke, her
      voice startled you with its depth, which was a kind of soft hoarseness,
      but capable of every shade of colour. There was a playful and impetuous
      raillery in nearly all she said, and everything seemed to be expressed by
      mind and body at the same time. She moved her body restlessly, and while
      standing in the same place her feet were always shuffling. Her dress was
      homely&mdash;almost poor&mdash;and perhaps a little careless. She appeared
      to smile and laugh continually, and yet there were tears in her eyes
      sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young clergyman was of a good average height, but he looked taller
      from a certain distinction of figure. When he raised his hat at the
      captain&rsquo;s greeting he showed a forehead like an arched wall, and a large,
      close-cropped head. He had a well-formed nose, a powerful chin, and full
      lips&mdash;all very strong and set for one so young. His complexion was
      dark&mdash;almost swarthy&mdash;and there was a certain look of the gipsy
      in his big golden-brown eyes with their long black lashes. He was clean
      shaven, and the lower part of his face seemed heavy under the splendid
      fire of the eyes above it. His manner had a sort of diffident restraint;
      he stood on the same spot without moving, and almost without raising his
      drooping head; his speech was grave and usually slow and laboured; his
      voice was bold and full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second bell had rung, and the old parson was making ready to go
      ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take care of this runaway, Mr. Storm, and deliver her safely at
      the door of the hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll keep an eye on her in that big Babylon over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she&rsquo;ll let me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, yes; I know she&rsquo;s as unstable as water and as hard to hold
      as a puff of wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was laughing again. &ldquo;You might as well call me a tempest and have
      done with it, or,&rdquo; with a glance at the younger man, &ldquo;say a storm&mdash;Glory
      St&mdash;&mdash; Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a little catch of the breath she arrested the name before it was
      uttered by her impetuous tongue, and laughed again to cover her confusion.
      The young man smiled faintly and rather painfully, but the old parson was
      conscious of nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and why not? A good name for you too, and you richly deserve it.&mdash;But
      the Lord is lenient with such natures, John. He never tries them beyond
      their strength. She hasn&rsquo;t much leaning to religion, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl recalled herself from the busy scene around and broke in again
      with a tone of humour and pathos mixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, call me an infidel at once, grandfather. I know what you mean. But
      just to show you that I haven&rsquo;t exactly registered a vow in heaven never
      to go to church in London because you&rsquo;ve given me such a dose of it in the
      Isle of Man, I&rsquo;ll promise to send you a full and particular report of Mr.
      Storm&rsquo;s first sermon. Isn&rsquo;t that charming of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The third bell was ringing, the blast of the steam whistle was echoing
      across the bay, and the steamer was only waiting for the mails. Taking a
      step nearer to the gangway, the old parson talked faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Aunt Anna give you money enough, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough for my boat fare and my train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more! Now Anna is so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble, grandfather. Woman wants but little here below&mdash;Aunt
      Anna excepted. And then a hospital nurse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll feel lonely in that great wilderness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonely with five millions of neighbours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be longing for the old island, Glory, and I half repent me already&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever I have the blue-devils, grandpa, I&rsquo;ll just whip on my cape and
      fly home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning I&rsquo;ll be searching all over the house for my runaway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory tried to laugh gaily. &ldquo;Upstairs, downstairs, and in my lady&rsquo;s
      chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Glory,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be crying, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the girl gone at all? I haven&rsquo;t heard
      her voice in the house to-day. What&rsquo;s come over the old place to strike it
      so dead?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s eyes were running over, but in a tone of gentle raillery and
      heart&rsquo;s love she said severely: &ldquo;Nonsense, grandfather, you&rsquo;ll forget all
      about Glory going to London before the day after to-morrow. Every morning
      you&rsquo;ll be making rubbings of your old runes, and every night you&rsquo;ll be
      playing chess with Aunt Rachel, and every Sunday you&rsquo;ll be scolding old
      Neilus for falling asleep in the reading desk, and&mdash;and everything
      will go on just the same as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mails had come aboard, one of the gangways had been drawn ashore, and
      the old parson, holding his big watch in his left hand, was diving into
      his fob-pocket with the fingers of the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rdquo;&mdash;panting audibly, as if he had been running hard&mdash;&ldquo;is
      your mother&rsquo;s little pearl ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl drew off her slack, soiled glove and took the ring in her nervous
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wonderful talisman is the relic of a good mother, sir,&rdquo; said the old
      parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young clergyman bent his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like Glory herself in that though&mdash;you don&rsquo;t remember your
      mother either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep in touch with your father, John, trust me for that. You and he
      shall be good friends yet. A man can&rsquo;t hold out against his son for
      nothing worse than choosing the Church against the world. The old man
      didn&rsquo;t mean all he said; and then it isn&rsquo;t the thunder that strikes people
      dead, you know. So leave him to me; and if that foolish old Chalse hasn&rsquo;t
      been putting notions into his head&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The throbbing in the steam funnel had ceased and in the sudden hush a
      voice from the bridge cried, &ldquo;All ashore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Glory! Good-bye, John! Good-bye both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, sir,&rdquo; said the young clergyman with a long hand-clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl&rsquo;s arms were about the old man&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Good-bye, you dear old
      grandpa, and I&rsquo;m ashamed I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry I&mdash;I mean it&rsquo;s a shame of
      me to&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my wandering gipsy, my witch, my runaway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you call me names I&rsquo;ll have to stop your mouth, sir. Again&mdash;another&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice cried, &ldquo;Stand back there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young clergyman drew the girl back from the bulwarks, and the steamer
      moved slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go below&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ll stay on deck. I&rsquo;ll go ashore&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t bear it; it&rsquo;s not too late yet. No, I&rsquo;ll go to the stern and see the
      water in the wake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pier was cleared and the harbour was empty. Over the white churning
      water the sea gulls were wheeling, and Douglas Head was gliding slowly
      back. Down the long line of the quay the friends of the passengers were
      waving adieus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is, on the end of the pier! That&rsquo;s grandpa waving his
      handkerchief! Don&rsquo;t you see it? The red-and-white cotton one! God bless
      him! How <i>wae</i> his little present made me! He has been keeping it all
      these years. But my silk handkerchief is too damp&mdash;it won&rsquo;t float at
      all. Will you lend me&mdash;&mdash;Ah, thank you! Good-bye! good-bye! good&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl hung over the stern rail, leaning her breast upon it and waving
      the handkerchief as long as the pier and its people were in sight, and
      when they were gone from recognition she watched the line of the land
      until it began to fade into the clouds, and there was no more to be seen
      of what she had looked upon every day of her life until to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear little island! I never thought it was so beautiful! Perhaps I
      might have been happy even there, if I had tried. Now, if I had only had
      somebody for company! How silly of me! I&rsquo;ve been five years wishing and
      praying to get away, and now! ... It <i>is</i> lovely, though, isn&rsquo;t it?
      Just like a bird on the water! And when you&rsquo;ve been born in a place ...
      the dear little island! And the old folks, too! How lonely they&rsquo;ll be,
      after all! I wonder if I shall ever.... I&rsquo;ll go below. The wind&rsquo;s
      freshening, and this water in the wake is making my eyes... Good-bye,
      little birdie! I&rsquo;ll come back&mdash;I&rsquo;ll.... Yes, never fear, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laughter and impetuous talking, the gentle humour and pathos, had
      broken at length into a sob, and the girl had wheeled about and
      disappeared down the cabin stairs. John Storm stood looking after her. He
      had hardly spoken, but his great brown eyes were moist.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her father had been the only son of Parson Quayle, and chaplain to the
      bishop at Bishopscourt. It was there he had met her mother, who was lady&rsquo;s
      maid to the bishop&rsquo;s wife. The maid was a bright young Frenchwoman,
      daughter of a French actress, famous in her day, and of an officer under
      the Empire, who had never been told of her existence. Shortly after their
      marriage the chaplain was offered a big mission station in Africa, and,
      being a devotee, he clutched at it without fear of the fevers of the
      coast. But his young French wife was about to become a mother, and she
      shrank from the perils of his life abroad, so he took her to his father&rsquo;s
      house at Peel, and bade her farewell for five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived four, and during that time they exchanged some letters. His final
      instructions were sent from Southampton: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a boy, call him John
      (after the Evangelist); and if it&rsquo;s a girl, call her Glory.&rdquo; At the end of
      the first year she wrote: &ldquo;I have shortened our darling, and you never saw
      anything so lovely! Oh, the sweetness of her little bare arms, and her
      neck, and her little round shoulders! You know she&rsquo;s red&mdash;I&rsquo;ve really
      got a red one&mdash;a curly red one! Such big beaming eyes, too! And then
      her mouth, and her chin, and her tiny red toes! I don&rsquo;t know how you can
      live without seeing her!&rdquo; Near the end of the fourth year he sent his last
      answer: &ldquo;Dear Wife&mdash;This separation is bitter; but God has willed it,
      and we must not forget that the probabilities are that we may pass our
      lives apart.&rdquo; The next letter was from the English consul on the Gaboon
      River, announcing the death of the devoted missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parson Quayle&rsquo;s household consisted only of himself and two maiden
      daughters, but that was too much for the lively young Frenchwoman. While
      her husband lived, she suffocated under the old-maid <i>régime</i>; and
      when he was gone she made no more fight with destiny, but took some simple
      ailment, and died suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bare hillside frowned down on the place where Glory was born; but the
      sun rose over it, and a beautiful river hugged its sides. A quarter of a
      mile down the river there was a harbour, and beyond the harbour a bay,
      with the ruins of an old castle standing out on an islet rock, and then
      the broad sweep of the Irish Sea-the last in those latitudes to &ldquo;parley
      with the setting sun.&rdquo; The vicarage was called Glenfaba, and it was half a
      mile outside the fishing town of Peel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory was a little red-headed witch from the first, with an air of general
      uncanniness in everything she did and said. Until after she was six there
      was no believing a word she uttered. Her conversation was bravely
      indifferent to considerations of truth or falsehood, fear or favour,
      reward or punishment. The parson used to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really afraid the child
      has no moral conscience&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t seem to know right from wrong.&rdquo;
       This troubled his religion, but it tickled his humour, and it did not
      disturb his love. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a perfect pagan&mdash;God bless her innocent
      heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had more than a child&rsquo;s genius for make-believe. In her hunger for
      child company, before the days when she found it for herself, she made
      believe that various versions of herself lived all over the place, and she
      would call them out to play. There was Glory in the river, under the pool
      where the perches swam, and Glory down the well, and Glory up in the
      hills, and they answered when she spoke to them. All her dolls were kings
      and queens, and she had a gift for making up in strange and grand
      disguises. It was almost as if her actress grandmother had bestowed on her
      from her birth the right to life and luxury and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a born mimic, and could hit off to a hair an eccentricity or an
      affectation. The frown of Aunt Anna, who was severe, the smile of Aunt
      Rachel, who was sentimental, and the yawn of Cornelius Kewley, the clerk
      who was always sleepy, lived again in the roguish, rippling face. She
      remembered some of her mother&rsquo;s French songs, and seeing a street-singer
      one day, she established herself in the market-place in that character,
      with grown people on their knees around her, ready to fall on her and kiss
      her and call her Phonodoree, the fairy. But she did not forget to go round
      for the ha&rsquo;pennies either.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten she was a tomboy, and marched through the town at the head of an
      army of boys, playing on a comb between her teeth and flying the vicar&rsquo;s
      handkerchief at the end of his walking-stick. In these days she climbed
      trees and robbed orchards (generally her own) and imitated boys&rsquo; voices,
      and thought it tyranny that she might not wear trousers. But she wore a
      sailor&rsquo;s blue stocking-cap, and it brightened existence when, for
      economy&rsquo;s sake and for the sake of general tidiness, she was allowed to
      wear a white woollen jersey. Then somebody who had a dinghy that he did
      not want asked her if she would like to have a boat. Would she like to
      have paradise, or pastry cakes, or anything that was heavenly! After that
      she wore a sailor&rsquo;s jacket and a sou&rsquo;wester when she was on the sea, and
      tumbled about the water like a duck.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve she fell in love&mdash;with love. It was a vague passion
      interwoven with dreams of grandeur. The parson being too poor to send her
      to the girls&rsquo; college at Douglas, and his daughters being too proud to
      send her to the dame&rsquo;s school at Peel, she was taught at home by Aunt
      Rachel, who read the poetry of Thomas Moore, knew the birthdays of all the
      royal family, and was otherwise meekly romantic. From this source she
      gathered much curious sentiment relating to some visionary world where
      young girls were held aloft in the sunshine of luxury and love and
      happiness. One day she was lying on her back on the heather of the Peel
      hill, with her head on her arms, thinking of a story that Aunt Rachel had
      told her. It was of a mermaid who had only to slip up out of the sea and
      say to any man, &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; and he came&mdash;he left everything and followed
      her. Suddenly the cold nose of a pointer rubbed against her forehead, a
      strong voice cried, &ldquo;Down, sir!&rdquo; and a young man of two and twenty, in
      leggings and a shooting-jacket, strode between her and the cliffs. She
      knew him by sight. He was John Storm, the son of Lord Storm, who had
      lately come to live in the mansion house at Knockaloe, a mile up the hill
      from Glenfaba.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three weeks thereafter she talked of nobody else, and even began to
      comb her hair. She watched him in church, and told Aunt Rachel she was
      sure he could see quite well in the dark, for his big eyes seemed to have
      the light inside of them. After that she became ashamed, and if anybody
      happened to mention his name in her hearing she flushed up to the forehead
      and fled out of the room. He never once looked at her, and after a while
      he went away to Canada. She set the clock on the back landing to Canadian
      time, so that she might always know what he was doing abroad, and then
      straightway forgot all about him. Her moods followed each other rapidly,
      and were all of them overpowering and all sincere, but it was not until a
      year afterward that she fell in love, in the church vestry, with the
      pretty boy who stood opposite to her in the catechism class.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an English boy of her own age, and he was only staying in the
      island for his holidays. The second time she saw him it was in the grounds
      at Glenfaba, while his mother was returning a call indoors. She gave him a
      little tap on the arm and he had to run after her&mdash;down a bank and up
      a tree, where she laughed and said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice?&rdquo; and he could see
      nothing but her big white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name was Francis Horatio Nelson Drake, and he was full of great
      accounts of the goings-on in the outer world, where his school was, and
      where lived the only &ldquo;men&rdquo; worth talking about. Of course he spoke of all
      this familiarly and with a convincing reality which wrapped Glory in the
      plumage of dreams. He was a wonderful being, altogether, and in due time
      (about three days) she proposed to him. True, he did not jump at her offer
      with quite proper alacrity, but when she mentioned that it didn&rsquo;t matter
      to her in the least whether he wanted her or not, and that plenty would be
      glad of the chance, he saw things differently, and they agreed to elope.
      There was no particular reason for this drastic measure, but as Glory had
      a boat, it seemed the right thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dressed herself in all her Confirmation finery, and stole out to meet
      him under the bridge where her boat lay moored. He kept her half an hour
      waiting, having sisters and other disadvantages, but &ldquo;once aboard her
      lugger,&rdquo; he was safe. She was breathless, and he was anxious, and neither
      thought it necessary to waste any time in kissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      They slipped down the harbour and out into the bay, and then ran up the
      sail and stood off for Scotland. Being more easy in mind when this was
      done, they had time to talk of the future. Francis Horatio was for work&mdash;he
      was going to make a name for himself. Glory did not see it quite in that
      light. A name, yes, and lots of triumphal processions, but she was for
      travel&mdash;there were such lots of things people could see if they
      didn&rsquo;t waste so much time working.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a girl you are!&rdquo; he said derisively; whereupon she bit her lip, for
      she didn&rsquo;t quite like it. But they were nearly half an hour out before he
      spoiled himself utterly. He had brought his dog, a she-terrier, and he
      began to call her by her kennel name and to say what a fine little thing
      she was, and what a deal of money they would make by her pups. That was
      too much for Glory. She couldn&rsquo;t think of eloping with a person who used
      such low expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a girl you are!&rdquo; he said again; but she did not mind it in the
      least. With a sweep of her bare arm she had put the tiller hard aport,
      intending to tack back to Peel, but the wind had freshened and the sea was
      rising, and by the swift leap of the boat the boom was snapped, and the
      helpless sail came napping down upon the mast. Then they tumbled into the
      trough, and Glory had not strength to pull them out of it, and the boy was
      of no more use than a tripper. She was in her white muslin dress, and he
      was nursing his dog, and the night was closing down on them, and they were
      wobbling about under a pole and a tattered rag. But all at once a great
      black yacht came heaving up in the darkness, and a grown-up voice cried,
      &ldquo;Trust yourself to me, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was John Storm. He had already awakened the young girl in her, and
      thereafter he awakened the young woman as well. She clung to him like a
      child that night, and during the four years following she seemed always to
      be doing the same. He was her big brother, her master, her lord, her
      sovereign. She placed him on a dizzy height above her, amid a halo of
      goodness and grandeur. If he smiled on her she flushed, and if he frowned
      she fretted and was afraid. Thinking to please him, she tried to dress
      herself up in all the colours of the rainbow, but he reproved her and bade
      her return to her jersey. She struggled to comb out her red curls until he
      told her that the highest ladies in the land would give both ears for
      them, and then she fondled them in her fingers and admired them in a
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a serious person, but she could make him laugh until he screamed.
      Excepting Byron and &ldquo;Sir Charles Grandison,&rdquo; out of the vicar&rsquo;s library,
      the only literature she knew was the Bible, the Catechism, and the Church
      Service, and she used these in common talk with appalling freedom and
      audacity. The favourite butt of her mimicry was the parish clerk saying
      responses when he was sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson: &ldquo;O Lord, open thou our lips&rdquo; (no response). &ldquo;Where are you,
      Neilus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk (awakening suddenly in the desk below): &ldquo;Here I am, your
      reverence&mdash;and our mouth shall show forth thy praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When John Storm did laugh he laughed beyond all control, and then Glory
      was entirely happy. But he went away again, his father having sent him to
      Australia, and all the light of her world went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of no use bothering with the clock on the back landing, because
      things were different by this time. She was sixteen, and the only tree she
      climbed now was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and that tore
      her terribly. John Storm was the son of a lord, and he would be Lord
      Something himself some day. Glory Quayle was an orphan, and her
      grandfather was a poor country clergyman. Their poverty was sweet, but
      there was gall in it, nevertheless. The little forced economies in dress,
      the frocks that had to be turned, the bonnets that were beauties when they
      were bought, but had to be worn until the changes of fashion made them
      frights, and then the mysterious parcels of left-off clothing from
      goodness knows where&mdash;how the independence of the girl&rsquo;s spirit
      rebelled against such humiliations!
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood of her mother was beginning to boil over, and the old-maid <i>régime</i>,
      which had crushed the life out of the Frenchwoman, was suffocating the
      Manx girl with its formalism. She was always forgetting the meal times
      regulated by the sun, and she could sleep at any time and keep awake until
      any hour. It tired her to sit demurely like a young lady, and she had a
      trick of lying down on the floor. She often laughed in order not to cry,
      but she would not even smile at a great lady&rsquo;s silly story, and she did
      not care a jot about the birthdays of the royal family. The old aunts
      loved her body and soul, but they often said, &ldquo;Whatever is going to happen
      to the girl when the grandfather is gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the grandfather&mdash;good man&mdash;would have laid down his life to
      save her a pain in her toe, but he had not a notion of the stuff she was
      made of. His hobby was the study of the runic crosses with which the Isle
      of Man abounds, and when she helped him with his rubbings and his casts he
      was as merry as an old sand-boy. Though they occupied the same house, and
      her bedroom that faced the harbour was next to his little musty study that
      looked over the scullery slates, he lived always in the tenth century and
      she lived somewhere in the twentieth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imprisoned linnet was beating at the bars of its cage. Before she was
      aware of it she wanted to escape from the sleepy old scene, and had begun
      to be consumed with longing for the great world outside. On summer
      evenings she would go up Peel Hill and lie on the heather, where she had
      first seen John Storm, and watch the ships weighing anchor in the bay
      beyond the old dead castle walls, and wish she were going out with them&mdash;out
      to the sea and the great cities north and south. But existence closed in
      ever-narrowing circles round her, and she could see no way out. Two years
      passed, and at eighteen she was fretting that half her life had wasted
      away. She watched the sun until it sank into the sea, and then she turned
      back to Glenfaba and the darkened region of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all the fault of their poverty, and their poverty was the fault of
      the Church. She began to hate the Church; It had made her an orphan; and
      when she thought of religion as a profession it seemed a selfish thing
      anyway. If a man was really bent on so lofty an aim (as her own father had
      been) he could not think of himself; he had to give up life and love and
      the world, and then these always took advantage of him. But people had to
      live in the world for all that, and what was the good of burying yourself
      before you were dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow her undefined wishes took shape in visions of John Storm, and one
      day she heard he was home again. She went out on the hill that evening
      and, being seen only by the gulls, she laughed and cried and ran. It was
      just like poetry, for there he was himself lying on the edge of the cliff
      near the very spot where she had been used to lie. On seeing him she went
      more slowly, and began to poke about in the heather as if she had seen
      nothing. He came up to her with both hands outstretched, and then suddenly
      she remembered that she was wearing her old jersey, and she flushed up to
      the eyes and nearly choked with shame. She got better by-and-bye and
      talked away like a mill-wheel, and then fearing he might think it was from
      something quite different, she began to pull the heather and to tell him
      why she had been blushing. He did not laugh at all. With a strange smile
      he said something in his deep voice that made her blood run cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m to be a poor man myself in future, Glory. I&rsquo;ve quarrelled with my
      father. I&rsquo;m going into the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a frightful blow to her, and the sun went down like a shot. But it
      burst open the bars of her cage for all that. After John Storm had found a
      curacy in London and taken Orders, he told them at Glenfaba that among his
      honorary offices was to be that of chaplain to a great West End hospital.
      This suggested to Glory the channel of escape. She would go out as a
      hospital nurse. It was easier said than done, for hospital nursing was
      fashionable, and she was three years too young. With great labour she
      secured her appointment as probationer, and with greater labour still
      overcame the fear and affection of her grandfather. But the old parson was
      finally appeased when he heard that Glory&rsquo;s hospital was the same that
      John Storm was to be chaplain of, and that they might go up to London
      together.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Grandfather Of Me, And Everybody At Glenfaba: Here I am at last,
      dears, at the end of my Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress, and the evening and the
      morning&rsquo; are the first day. It is now eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, and I am
      about to put myself to bed in my own little room at the hospital of
      Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, Hyde Park, London, England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain was quite right; the morning was as fresh as his flattery,
      and before we got far beyond the Head most of the passengers were spread
      out below like the three legs of Man. Being an old sea-doggie myself, I
      didn&rsquo;t give it the chance to make me sick, but went downstairs and lay
      quiet in my berth and deliberated great things. I didn&rsquo;t go up again until
      we got into the Mersey, and then the passengers were on deck, looking like
      sour buttermilk spilt out of the churn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a glorious sight! The ships, the docks, the towers, the town! I
      couldn&rsquo;t breathe for excitement until we got up to the landing-stage. Mr.
      Storm put me into a cab, and for the sake of experience I insisted on
      paying my own way. Of course he tried to trick me, but a woman&rsquo;s a woman
      for a&rsquo; that. As we drove up to Lime Street station there befell&mdash;a
      porter. He carried my big trunk on his head (like a mushroom), and when I
      bought my ticket he took me to the train while Mr. Storm went for a
      newspaper. Being such a stranger, he was very kind, so I flung the
      responsibility on Providence and gave him sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were two old ladies in the carriage beside ourselves, and the train
      we travelled by was an express. It was perfectly delightful, and for all
      the world like plunging into a stiff sou&rsquo;wester off the rocks at Contrary.
      But the first part of the journey was terrible. That tunnel nearly made me
      shriek. It was a misty day too at Liverpool, and all the way to Edge Hill
      they let off signals with a noise like battering-rams. My nerves were on
      the rack; so taking advantage of the darkness of the carriage, I began to
      sing. That calmed me, but it nearly drove the old ladies out of their
      wits. <i>They</i> screamed if I didn&rsquo;t; and just as I was summoning the
      Almighty to attend to me a little in the middle of that inferno, out we
      came as innocent as a baby. There was another of these places just before
      getting into London. I suppose they are purgatories through which you have
      to pass to get to these wonderful cities. Only if I had been consulted in
      the making of the Litany (&lsquo;from sudden death, good Lord, deliver us&rsquo;) I
      should have made an exception for people in tunnels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never knew what an absolute ninny Glory is! I was burning with such
      impatience to see London that when we came near it I couldn&rsquo;t see anything
      for water under the brain. Approaching a great and mighty city for the
      first time must be like going into the presence of majesty. Only Heaven
      save me from such palpitation the day I become songstress to the Queen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! what a roar and boom&mdash;a deep murmur as of ten hundred million
      million moths humming away on a still evening in autumn! On a nearer view
      it is more like a Tower-of-Babel concern, with its click and clatter. The
      explosion of voices, the confused clamour, the dreadful disorder&mdash;cars,
      wagons, omnibuses&mdash;it makes you feel religious and rather cold down
      the back. What a needle in a haystack a poor girl must be here if there is
      nobody above to keep track of her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Aunt Rachel they are wearing another kind of bonnet in London&mdash;more
      pokey in front&mdash;and say if I see the Queen I&rsquo;ll be sure to tell her
      all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get to the hospital until nine, so I&rsquo;ve not seen much of it
      yet. The housekeeper gave me tea and told me I might go over the house, as
      I wouldn&rsquo;t be wanted to begin duty before morning. So for an hour I went
      from ward to ward like a female Wandering Jew. Such silence! I&rsquo;m afraid
      this hospital nursing is going to be a lockjaw business. And now I&rsquo;m going
      to bed&mdash;well, not homesick, you know, but just &lsquo;longing a lil bit for
      all.&rsquo; To-morrow morning I&rsquo;ll waken up to new sounds and sights, and when I
      draw my blind I&rsquo;ll see the streets where the cars are forever running and
      rattling. Then I&rsquo;ll think of Glenfaba and the birds singing and rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dispense my love throughout the island. Say that I love everybody just
      the same now I&rsquo;m a London lady as when I was a mere provincial girl, and
      that when I&rsquo;m a wonderful woman, and have brought the eyes of England upon
      me, I&rsquo;ll come back and make amends. I can hear what grandfather is saying:
      &lsquo;Gough bless me, what a girl, though!&rsquo; Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve not said much about Mr. Storm. He left me at the door of
      the hospital and went on to the house of his vicar, for that is where he
      is to lodge, you know. On the way up I expended much beautiful poetry upon
      him on the subject of love. The old girlies having dozed off, I chanced to
      ask him if he liked to talk of it, but he said no, it was a profanation.
      Love was too sacred, it was a kind of religion. Sometimes it came
      unawares, sometimes it smouldered like fire under ashes, sometimes it was
      a good angel, sometimes a devil, making you do things and say things, and
      laying your life waste like winter. But I told him it was just charming,
      and as for religion, there was nothing under heaven like the devotion of a
      handsome and clever man to a handsome and clever woman, when he gave up
      all the world for her, and his body and his soul and everything that was
      his. I think he saw there was something in that, for though he said
      nothing, there came a wonderful light into his splendid eyes, and I
      thought if he wasn&rsquo;t going to be a clergyman&mdash;but no matter. So long,
      dear!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Storm was the son of Lord Storm (a peer in his own right), and nephew
      of the Prime Minister of England, the Earl of Erin. Two years before
      John&rsquo;s birth the brothers had quarrelled about a woman. It was John&rsquo;s
      mother. She had engaged herself to the younger brother, and afterward
      fallen in love with the elder one. The voice of conscience told her that
      it was her duty to carry out her engagement, and she did so. Then the
      voice of conscience took sides with the laws of life and told the lovers
      that they must renounce each other, and they both did that as well. But
      the poor girl found it easier to renounce life than love, and after flying
      to religion as an escape from the conflict between conjugal duty and
      elemental passion she gave birth to her child and died. She was the
      daughter of a rich banker, who had come from the soil, and she had been
      brought up to consider marriage distinct from love. Exchanging wealth for
      title, she found death in the deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband had never stood in any natural affinity to her. On his part,
      their marriage had been a loveless and selfish union, based on the desire
      for an heir that he might found a family and cancel the unfair position of
      a younger son. But the sin he committed against the fundamental law, that
      marriage shall be founded only in love, brought its swift revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing that the wife was dead, the elder brother came to attend the
      funeral. The night before that event the husband felt unhappy about the
      part he had played. He had given no occasion for scandal, but he had never
      disguised, even from the mother of his son, the motives of his marriage.
      The poor girl was gone; he had only trained himself for the pursuit of her
      dowry, and the voice of love had been silent. Troubled by such thoughts,
      he walked about his room all night long, and somewhere in the first dead
      gray of dawn he went down to the death chamber that he might look upon her
      face again. Opening the door, he heard the sound of half-stifled sobs.
      Some one was leaning over the white face and weeping like a man with a
      broken heart. It was his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time forward Lord Storm considered himself the injured person.
      He had never cared for his brother, and now he designed to wipe him out.
      His son would do it. He was the heir to the earldom, for the earl had
      never married. But a posthumous revenge was too trivial. The earl had gone
      into politics and was making a name. Lord Storm had missed his own
      opportunities, though he had got himself called to the Upper House, but
      his son should be brought up to eclipse everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end the father devoted his life to the boy&rsquo;s training. All
      conventional education was wrong in principle. Schools and colleges and
      the study of the classics were drivelling folly, with next to nothing to
      do with life. Travel was the great teacher. &ldquo;You shall travel as far as
      the sun,&rdquo; he said. So the boy was taken through Europe and Asia and
      learned something of many languages. He became his father&rsquo;s daily
      companion, and nowhere the father went was it thought wrong for the boy to
      go also. Conventional morality was considered mawkish. The chief aim of
      home training was to bring children up in total ignorance, if possible, of
      the most important facts and functions of life. But it was <i>not</i>
      possible, and hence suppression, dissimulation, lying, and, under the ban
      of secret sin, one half the world&rsquo;s woe. So the boy was taken to the
      temples of Greece and India, and even to Western casinos and dancing
      gardens. Before he was twenty he had seen something of nearly everything
      the world has in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came to think of his career England was in straits about her
      colonial empire. The vast lands over sea wanted to take care of
      themselves. It was the moment of the &ldquo;British North America Act,&rdquo; and that
      gave the father his cue for action. While his brother the earl was
      fiddling the country to the tune of limited self-government for Crown
      colonies, the father of John Storm conceived the daring idea of breaking
      up the entire empire, including the United Kingdom, into self-governing
      states. They were to be the &ldquo;United States of Great Britain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was to be John Storm&rsquo;s policy, and to work it out Lord Storm set up a
      house in the Isle of Man where he might always look upon his plan in
      miniature. There he established a bureau for the gathering of the data
      that his son would need to use hereafter. Newspapers came to him in his
      lonely retreat from all quarters of the globe, and he cut out everything
      relating to his subject. His library was a dusty room lined all around
      with brown-paper pockets, which were labelled with the names of colonies
      and counties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will take us two generations to do it, my boy, but we&rsquo;ll alter the
      history of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At fifty he was iron-gray, and had a head like a big owl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the object of these grand preparations, the offspring of that
      loveless union, had a personality all his own. It seemed as if he had been
      built for a big man every way, and Nature had been arrested in the making
      of him. When people looked at his head they felt he ought to have been a
      giant, but he was far from rivalling the children of Anak. When they
      listened to his conversation they thought he might turn out to be a
      creature of genius, but perhaps he was only a man of powerful moods. The
      best strength of body and mind seemed to have gone into his heart. It may
      be that the sorrowful unrest of his mother and her smothered passion had
      left their red stream in John Storm&rsquo;s soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was a boy he would cry at a beautiful view in Nature, at a tale of
      heroism, or at any sentimental ditty sung excruciatingly in the streets.
      Seeing a bird&rsquo;s nest that had been robbed of its eggs he burst into tears;
      but when he came upon the bleeding, broken shells in the path, the tears
      turned to fierce wrath and mad rage, and he snatched up a gun out of his
      father&rsquo;s room and went out to take the life of the offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming to the Isle of Man he noticed as often as he went to church that
      a little curly red-headed girl kept staring at him from the vicar&rsquo;s pew.
      He was a man of two-and-twenty, but the child&rsquo;s eyes tormented him. At any
      time of day or night he could call up a vision of their gleaming
      brightness. Then his father sent him to Canada to watch the establishment
      of the Dominion, and when he came back he brought a Canadian canoe and an
      American yacht, and certain democratic opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time he sailed the yacht in Manx waters he sighted a disabled
      boat and rescued two children. One of them was the girl of the vicar&rsquo;s
      pew, grown taller and more winsome. She nestled up to him when he lifted
      her into the yacht, and, without knowing why, he kept his arms about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he called his yacht the <i>Gloria</i>, in imitation of her
      name, and sometimes took the girl out on the sea. Notwithstanding the
      difference of the years between them, they had their happy boy and girl
      days together. In her white jersey and stocking-cap she looked every inch
      a sailor. When the wind freshened and the boat plunged she stood to the
      tiller like a man, and he thought her the sweetest sight ever seen in a
      cockpit. And when the wind saddened and the boom came aboard she was the
      cheeriest companion in a calm. She sang, and so did he, and their voices
      went well together. Her favourite song was &ldquo;Come, Lasses and Lads&rdquo;; his
      was &ldquo;John Peel&rdquo;; and they would sing them off and on for an hour at a
      spell. Thus on a summer evening, when the bay was lying like a tired
      monster asleep, and every plash of an oar was echoing on the hills, the
      people on the land would hear them coming around the castle rock with
      their&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye ken John Peel, with his coat so gay?
  D&rsquo;ye ken John Peel at the break of day?
  D&rsquo;ye ken John P-e-e-l....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      For two years he amused himself with the child, and then realized that she
      was a child no longer. The pity of the girl&rsquo;s position took hold of him.
      This sunny soul with her sportfulness, her grace of many gifts, with her
      eyes that flashed and gleamed like lightning, with her voice that was like
      the warble of a bird, this golden-headed gipsy, this witch, this fairy&mdash;what
      was the life that lay before her? Pity gave place to a different feeling,
      and then he was aware of a pain in the breast when he thought of the girl.
      As often as her eyes lasted upon him he felt his face tingle and burn. He
      began to be conscious of an imprisoned side to his nature, the passionate
      side, and he drew back afraid. This wild power, this tempest, this raging
      fire within, God only knew whither it was to lead him. And then he had
      given a hostage to fortune, or his father had for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his father&rsquo;s gloomy house at Knockaloe, where the winds were ever
      droning in the trees, he looked over to Glenfaba, and it seemed to him
      like a little white cloud lit up by the sunshine. His heart was forever
      calling to the sunny spot over there, &ldquo;Glory! Glory!&rdquo; The pity of it was
      that the girl seemed to understand everything, and to know quite well what
      kept them apart. She flushed with shame that he should see her wearing the
      same clothes constantly, and with head aside and furtive glances she
      talked of the days when he would leave the island for good, and London
      would take him and make much of him, and he would forget all about his
      friends in that dead old place. Such talk cut him to the quick. Though he
      had seen a deal of the world, he did not know much about the conversation
      of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle was brief. He began to wear plainer clothes&mdash;an Oxford
      tweed coat and a flannel shirt&mdash;to talk about fame as an empty word,
      and to tell his father that he was superior to all stupid conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father sent him to Australia. Then the grown-up trouble of his life
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through the world now with eyes open for the privations of the
      poor, and he saw everything in a new light. Unconsciously he was doing in
      another way what his mother had done when she flew to religion from
      stifled passion. He had been brought up as a sort of imperialist democrat,
      but now he bettered his father&rsquo;s instructions. England did not want more
      Parliaments, she wanted more apostles. It was not by giving votes to a
      nation, but by strengthening the soul of a nation, that it became great
      and free. The man for the hour was not he who revolved schemes for making
      himself famous, but he who was ready to renounce everything, and if he was
      great was willing to become little, and if he was rich to become poor.
      There was room for an apostle&mdash;for a thousand apostles&mdash;who,
      being dead to the world&rsquo;s glory, its money or its calls, were prepared to
      do all in Christ&rsquo;s spirit, and to believe that in the renunciation, which
      was the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of Jesus, lay the only salvation remaining for the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tramped through the slums of Melbourne and Sydney, and afterward
      through the slums of London, returned to the Isle of Man a Christian
      Socialist, and announced to his father his intention of going into the
      Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man did not fume and fly out. He staggered back to his room like a
      bullock to its pen after it has had its death-blow in the shambles. In the
      midst of his dusty old bureau, with its labelled packets full of cuttings,
      he realized that twenty years of his life had been wasted. A son was a
      separate being, of a different growth, and a father was only the seed at
      the root that must decay and die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he made some show of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But with your talents, boy, surely you are not going to throw away your
      chances of a great name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care nothing for a great name, father,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I shall win a
      greater victory than any that Parliament can give me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my boy, my dear boy! one must either be the camel or the
      camel-driver; and then society&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate society, and society would hate me. It is only for the sake of the
      few godly men that God spares it as he spared Sodom for Lot&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having braved this ordeal and nearly broken the heart of his old father,
      he turned for his reward to Glory. He found her at her usual haunt on the
      headlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was blushing when you came up, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Shall I tell you
      why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was this,&rdquo; she said, with a sweep of her hand across her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand? This old rag&mdash;it&rsquo;s the one I was wearing
      before you went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to tell her how well she looked in it&mdash;better than ever now
      that her bosom showed under its seamless curves, and her figure had grown
      so lithe and shapely. But though she was laughing he saw she was ashamed
      of her poverty, and he thought to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to be a poor man myself in future, Glory. I&rsquo;ve quarrelled with my
      father. I&rsquo;m going to take Orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face fell. &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t think anybody would be poor who could help
      it. To be a clergyman is all right for a poor man, perhaps, but I hate to
      be poor; it&rsquo;s horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then darkness fell upon his eyes and he felt sad and sick. Glory had
      disappointed him. She was vain, she was worldly, she was incapable of the
      higher things; she would never know what a sacrifice he had made for her;
      she would think nothing of him now; but he would go on all the same, the
      more earnestly because the devil had drawn a bow at him and the arrow had
      gone in up to the feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With God&rsquo;s help I shall nail my colours to the mast,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he made up his mind to follow the unrolling of the scroll. He had the
      strength called character. The Church had been his beacon before, but now
      it was to be his refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found no difficulty in making the necessary preparations. For a year he
      read the Anglican divines&mdash;Jeremy Taylor, Hooker, Butler, Waterland,
      Pearson, and Pusey&mdash;and when the time came for his ordination his
      uncle, the Earl of Erin, who was now Prime Minister, obtained him a title
      to a curacy under the popular and influential Canon Wealthy of All Saints,
      Belgravia. The Bishop of London gave letters dimissory to the Bishop of
      Sodor and Man, by whom he was examined and ordained.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of his departure for London his father, with whom there had
      in the meantime been trying scenes, left him this final word of farewell:
      &ldquo;As I understand that you intend to lead the life of poverty, I presume
      that you do not need your mother&rsquo;s dowry, and I shall hold myself at
      liberty to dispose of it elsewhere, <i>unless</i> you require it for the
      use of the young lady who is, I hear, to go up with you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be a poor man among poor men,&rdquo; said John Storm to himself as he
      drove to his vicar&rsquo;s house in Eaton Place, but he awoke next morning in a
      bedroom that did not answer to his ideas of a life of poverty. A footman
      came with hot water and tea, and also a message from the canon overnight
      saying he would be pleased to see Mr. Storm in the study after breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study was a sumptuous apartment immediately beneath, with soft carpets
      on which his feet made no noise, and tiger-skins over the backs of chairs.
      As he entered it a bright-faced man in middle life, clean-shaven, wearing
      a gold-mounted <i>pince-nez</i>, and bubbling over with politeness,
      stepped forward to receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome to London, my dear Mr. Storm. When the letter came from the Prime
      Minister I said to my daughter Felicity&mdash;you will see her presently&mdash;I
      trust you will be good friends&mdash;I said, &lsquo;It is a privilege, my child,
      to meet any wish of the dear Earl of Erin, and I am proud to be in at the
      beginning of a career that is sure to be brilliant and distinguished.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm made some murmur of dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you found your rooms to your taste, Mr. Storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had found them more than he expected or desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, humble but comfortable, and in any case please regard them as
      your own, to receive whom you please therein, and to dispense your own
      hospitalities. This house is large enough. We shall not meet oftener than
      we wish, so we can not quarrel. The only meal we need take together is
      dinner. Don&rsquo;t expect too much. Simple but wholesome&mdash;that&rsquo;s all we
      can promise you in a clergyman&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm answered that food was an indifferent matter to him, and that
      half an hour after dinner he never knew what he had eaten. The canon
      laughed and began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it best you should come to us, being a stranger in London,
      though I confess I have never had but one of my clergy residing with me
      before. He is here now. You&rsquo;ll see him by-and-bye. His name is Golightly,
      a simple, worthy young man, from one of the smaller colleges, I believe.
      Useful, you know, devoted to me and to my daughter, but of course a
      different sort of person altogether, and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a peculiarity of the canon that whatever he began to talk about, he
      always ended by talking of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent for you this morning, not having had the usual opportunity of
      meeting before, that I might tell you something of our organization and
      your own duties.... You see in me the head of a staff of six clergy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was not surprised; a great preacher must be followed by flocks
      of the poor; it was natural that they should wish him to help them and to
      minister to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no poor in my parish, Mr. Storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No poor, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, her Majesty herself is one of my parishioners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be a great grief to you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the poor! Ah, yes, certainly. Of course, we have our associated
      charities, such as the Maternity Home, founded in Soho by Mrs. Callender&mdash;a
      worthy old Scotswoman&mdash;odd and whimsical, perhaps, but rich, very
      rich and influential. My clergy, however, have enough to do with the
      various departments of our church work. For instance, there is the Ladies&rsquo; 
      Society, the Fancy Needlework classes, and the Decorative Flower Guild,
      not to speak of the daughter churches and the ministration in hospitals,
      for I always hold&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s mind had been wandering, but at the mention of the hospital
      he looked up eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, the hospital. Your own duties will be chiefly concerned with our
      excellent hospital of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. You will have the spiritual care
      of all patients and nurses&mdash;yes, nurses also&mdash;within its
      precincts, precisely as if it were your parish. &lsquo;This is my parish,&rsquo; you
      will say to yourself, and treat it accordingly. Not yet being in full
      Orders, you will be unable to administer the sacrament, but you will have
      one service daily in each of the wards, taking the wards in rotation.
      There are seven wards, so there will be one service in each ward once a
      week, for I always say that fewer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it enough?&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I shall be only too pleased&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, we&rsquo;ll see. On Wednesday evenings we have service in the church,
      and nurses not on night duty are expected to attend. Some fifty of them
      altogether, and rather a curious compound. Ladies among them? Yes, the
      daughters of gentlemen, but also persons of all classes. You will hold
      yourself responsible for their spiritual welfare. Let me see&mdash;this is
      Friday&mdash;say you take the sermon on Wednesday next, if that is
      agreeable. As to views, my people are of all shades of colour, so I ask my
      clergy to take strictly <i>via media</i> views&mdash;strictly <i>via media</i>.
      Do you intone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had been wandering again, but he recovered himself in time to
      say he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a pity; our choir is so excellent&mdash;two violins, a viola,
      clarinet, &lsquo;cello, double bass, the trumpets and drums, and of course the
      organ. Our organist himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a young clergyman came into the room, making apologies and
      bowing subserviently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, this is Mr. Golightly&mdash;the-h&rsquo;m&mdash;Hon. and Rev. Mr. Storm.&mdash;You
      will take charge of Mr. Storm and bring him to church on Sunday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Golightly delivered his message. It was about the organist. His wife
      had called to say that he had been removed to the hospital for some slight
      operation, and there was some difficulty about the singer of Sunday
      morning&rsquo;s anthem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most irritating! Bring her up.&rdquo; The curate went out backward. &ldquo;I shall
      ask you to excuse me, Mr. Storm. My daughter, Felicity&mdash;ah, here she
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall young woman in spectacles entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is our new housemate, Mr. Storm, nephew of dear Lord Erin. Felicity,
      my child, I wish you to drive Mr. Storm round and introduce him to our
      people, for I always say a young clergyman in London&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm mumbled something about the Prime Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to pay your respects to your uncle now? Very good and proper. Next
      week will do for the visits. Yes, yes. Come in, Mrs. Koenig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A meek, middle-aged woman had appeared at the door. She was dark, and had
      deep luminous eyes with the moist look to be seen in the eyes of a tired
      old terrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the wife of our organist and choir master. Good day! Kindest
      greetings to the Prime Minister.... And, by the way, let us say Monday for
      the beginning of your chaplaincy at the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Erin, as First Lord of the Treasury, occupied the narrow,
      unassuming brick house which is the Treasury residence in Downing Street.
      Although the official head of the Church, with power to appoint its
      bishops and highest dignitaries, he was secretly a sceptic, if not openly
      a derider of spiritual things. For this attitude his early love passage
      had been chiefly accountable. That strife between duty and passion which
      had driven the woman he loved to religion had driven him in the other
      direction and left a broad swath of desolation in his soul. He had seen
      little of his brother since that evil time, and nothing whatever of his
      brother&rsquo;s son. Then John had written, &ldquo;I am soon to be bound by the awful
      tie of the priesthood,&rdquo; and he had thought it necessary to do something
      for him. When John was announced he felt a thrill of tender feeling to
      which he had long been a stranger. He got up and waited. The young man
      with his mother&rsquo;s face and the eyes of an enthusiast was coming down the
      long corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm saw his uncle first in the spacious old cabinet room which
      looks out on the little garden and the Park. He was a gaunt old man with,
      meagre mustache and hair, and a face like a death&rsquo;s head. He held out his
      hand and smiled. His hand was cold and his smile was half tearful and half
      saturnine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like your mother, John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John never knew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I saw her last you were a child in arms and she was younger than you
      are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was that, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her coffin, poor girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister shuffled some papers and said, &ldquo;Well, is there anything
      you wish for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I&rsquo;ve come to thank you for what you&rsquo;ve done already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister made a deprecatory gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost wish you had chosen another career, John. Still, the Church has
      its opportunities and its chances, and if I can ever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied; more than satisfied,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;My choice is based, I
      trust, on a firm vocation. God&rsquo;s work is great, sir; the greatest of all
      in London. That is why I am so grateful to you. Think of it, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was leaning forward in his chair with one arm stretched out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the five millions of people in this vast city, not one million cross
      the threshold of church or chapel. And then remember their condition. A
      hundred thousand live in constant want, slowly starving to death, every
      day and hour, and a quarter of the old people of London die as paupers.
      Isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful scene, sir? If a man is willing to be spiritually
      dead to the world&mdash;to leave family and friends&mdash;to go forth
      never to return, as one might go to his execution&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister listened to the ardent young man who was talking to him
      there with his mother&rsquo;s voice, and then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve made a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent you to the wrong place, John. When you wrote, I naturally
      supposed you were thinking of the Church as a career, and I tried to put
      you in the way of it. Do you know anything of your vicar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John knew that fame spoke of him as a great preacher&mdash;one of the few
      who had passed through their Pentecost and come out with the gift of
      tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely!&rdquo; The Prime Minister gave a bitter little laugh. &ldquo;But let me
      tell you something about him. He was a poor curate in the country where
      the lord of the manor chanced to be a lady. He married the lady of the
      manor. His wife died and he bought a London parish. Then, by the help of
      an old actor who gave lessons in elocution, he&mdash;well, he set up his
      Pentecost. Since then he has been a fashionable preacher and frequents the
      houses of great people. Ten years ago he was made an honorary canon, and,
      when he hears of an appointment to a bishopric, he says in a tearful
      voice, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the dear Queen has got against me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I had known you felt like that I should scarcely have sent you
      to Canon Wealthy. And yet I hardly know where else a young man of your
      opinions ... I&rsquo;m afraid the Church has a good many Canon Wealthys in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;No doubt there are Pharisees in these days just
      as in the days of Christ, but the Church is still the pillar of the State&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The caterpillar, you mean, boy&mdash;eating out its heart and its
      vitals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister gave another bitter little laugh, then looked quickly
      into John&rsquo;s flushed face and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s poor work for an old man to sap away a young man&rsquo;s enthusiasm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that, uncle,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;because God is the absolute ruler
      of all things, good and bad, and he governs both to his glory. Let him
      only give us strength to endure our exile&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear you talk like that, John. I think I know what the
      upshot will be. There&rsquo;s a gang of men about&mdash;Anglican Catholics they
      call themselves; well, remember the German proverb, &lsquo;Every priestling
      hides a popeling.&rsquo; ... And if you <i>are</i> to be in the Church, John, is
      there any reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t marry and be reasonable? To tell you
      the truth, I&rsquo;m rather a lonely old man, whatever I may seem, and if your
      mother&rsquo;s son would give me a sort of a grandson&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister was pretending to laugh again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, John, come, it seems a pity&mdash;a fine young fellow like you,
      too. Are there no sweet young girls about in these days? Or are they all
      dead and gone since I was a young fellow? I could give you a wide choice,
      you know, for when a man stands high enough ... in fact, you would find me
      reasonable&mdash;you might have anybody you liked, rich or poor, dark or
      fair.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had been sitting in torment, and now he rose to go. &ldquo;No,
      uncle,&rdquo; he said, in a thicker voice, &ldquo;I shall never marry. A clergyman who
      is married is bound to life by too many ties. Even his affection for his
      wife is a tie. And then there is her affection for the world, its riches,
      its praise, its honours.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, we&rsquo;ll say no more. After all, it&rsquo;s better than running wild,
      and that&rsquo;s what most young men seem to be doing nowadays. But then your
      long education abroad&mdash;and your poor father left to look after
      himself! Good-day to you. Come and see me now and then. How like your
      mother you are sometimes! Good-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the door of the cabinet room closed on John Storm the Prime Minister
      thought, &ldquo;Poor boy, he&rsquo;s laying up for himself a big heartache one of
      these fine days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And John Storm, going down the street with uncertain step, said to
      himself: &ldquo;How strange he should talk like that! But, thank God, he didn&rsquo;t
      produce a flicker in me. I died to all that a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he lifted his head and his footstep lightened, and deep in some
      secret place the thought came proudly, &ldquo;She shall see that to renounce the
      world is to possess the world&mdash;that a man may be poor and have all
      the kingdom of the world at his feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back by the Underground from Westminster Bridge. It was midday,
      and the train was crowded. His spirits were high and he talked with every
      one near him. Getting out at Victoria, he came upon his vicar on the
      platform and saluted him rather demonstratively. The canon responded with
      some restraint and then stepped into a first-class carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      On turning into Eaton Place he came upon a group of people standing around
      something that lay on the pavement. It was an old woman, a tattered,
      bedraggled creature with a pinched and pallid face. &ldquo;Is it an accident?&rdquo; a
      gentleman was saying, and somebody answered, &ldquo;No, sir, she&rsquo;s gorn off in a
      faint.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t some one take her to the hospital?&rdquo; said the
      gentleman, and then, like the Levite, he passed by on the other side. The
      butcher&rsquo;s cart drew up at the curb, and the butcher jumped down, saying,
      &ldquo;There never <i>is</i> no p&rsquo;lice about when they&rsquo;re wanted for anythink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they aren&rsquo;t wanted here, friend,&rdquo; said somebody from the outside. It
      was John Storm, and he was pushing his way through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will somebody knock at that door, please?&rdquo; He lifted the old thing in his
      arms and carried her toward the canon&rsquo;s house. The footman looked aghast.
      &ldquo;Let me know when the canon returns,&rdquo; said John, and then marched up the
      carpeted stairs to his rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterward the old woman opened her eyes and said: &ldquo;Anythink gorn
      wrong? Wot&rsquo;s up? Is it the work&rsquo;us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a clear case of destitution and collapse. John Storm began to feed
      the old creature with the chicken and milk sent up for his own lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time in the afternoon he heard the voice and step of the vicar in the
      room below. Going down to the study, he was about to knock; but the voice
      continued in varying tones, now loud, now low. During a pause he rapped,
      and then, with noticeable irritation, the voice cried, &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found the vicar, with a manuscript in hand, rehearsing his Sunday&rsquo;s
      sermon. It was a shock to John, but it helped him to understand what his
      uncle had said about the canon&rsquo;s Pentecost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canon&rsquo;s brow was clouded. &ldquo;Ah, is it you? I was sorry to see you
      getting out of a third-class carriage to-day, Mr. Storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John answered that it was the poor man&rsquo;s class, and therefore, he thought,
      it ought to be his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do yourself an injustice, Mr. Storm. Besides, to tell you the truth,
      I don&rsquo;t choose that my assistant clergy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John looked ashamed. &ldquo;If that is your view, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      what you&rsquo;ll say to what I&rsquo;ve been doing since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of it, and I confess I&rsquo;m not pleased. Whatever your old <i>protégée</i>
      may be, my house is no place for her. I help to maintain charitable
      institutions for such cases, and I will ask you to lose no time in having
      her removed to the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was crushed. &ldquo;Very well, sir, if that is your wish; only I thought
      you said my rooms&mdash;&mdash;Besides, the poor old thing fills her place
      as well as Queen Victoria, and perhaps the angels are watching the one as
      much as the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day John Storm called to see the old woman at Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, and
      he saw the matron, the house doctor, and a staff nurse as well. His
      adventure was known to everybody at the hospital. Once or twice he caught
      looks of amused compassion, and heard a twitter of laughter. As he stood
      by the bed, the old woman muttered: &ldquo;I knoo ez it wuzn&rsquo;t the work&rsquo;us, my
      dear. He spoke to me friendly and squeedged my &lsquo;and.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coming through the wards he had looked for a face he could not see; but
      just then he was aware of a young woman, in the print dress and white
      apron of a nurse, standing in silence at the bed-head. It was Glory, and
      her eyes were wet with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t do such things,&rdquo; she said hoarsely; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it,&rdquo; and
      she stamped her foot. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that these people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she turned about and was gone before he could reply. Glory was ashamed
      for him. Perhaps she had been taking his part! He felt the blood mounting
      to his face, and his cheeks tingling. Glory! His eyes were swimming, and
      he dared not look after her; but he could have found it in his heart to
      kiss the old bag of bones on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he wrote to the parson in the island: &ldquo;Glory has left off her
      home garments, and now looks more beautiful than ever in the white
      simplicity of the costume of the nurse. Her vocation is a great one. God
      grant she may hold on to it!&rdquo; Then something about the fallacy of
      ceremonial religion and the impossibility of pleasing God by such
      religious formalities. &ldquo;But if we have publicans and Pharisees now, even
      as they existed in Christ&rsquo;s time, all the more service is waiting for that
      man for whom life has no ambitions, death no terrors. I thank God I am in
      a great measure dead to these things.... I will fulfil my promise to look
      after Glory. My constant prayer is against Agag. It is so easy for him to
      get a foothold in a girl&rsquo;s heart here. This great new world, with its
      fashions, its gaieties, its beauty, and its brightness&mdash;no wonder if
      a beautiful young girl, tingling with life and ruddy health, should burn
      with impatience to fling herself into the arms of it. Agag is in London,
      and as insinuating as ever.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Sunday morning his fellow-curate came to his room to accompany him to
      church. The Rev. Joshua Golightly was a little man with a hook nose, small
      keen eyes, scanty hair, and a voice that was something between a whisper
      and a whistle. He bowed subserviently, and made meek little speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do trust you will not be disappointed with our church and service. We
      do all we can to make them worthy of our people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they walked down the streets he talked first of the church officers&mdash;there
      were honorary wardens, gentlemen sidesmen, and lady superintendents of
      floral decorations; then of the choir, which consisted of organist and
      choir master, professional members, voluntary members, and choir
      secretary. The anthem was sung by a professional singer, generally the
      tenor from the opera; the canon could always get such people&mdash;he was
      a great favourite with artistes and &ldquo;the profession.&rdquo; Of course, the
      singers were paid, and the difficulty this week had been due to the
      exorbitant fee demanded by the Italian barytone from Covent Garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disappointment and disenchantment were falling on John Storm at every
      step.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Saints&rsquo; was a plain, dark structure with a courtyard in front. The
      bells were ringing, and a line of carriages was drawing up at the portico
      as at the entrance to a theatre, discharging their occupants and passing
      on. Vergers in yellow and buff, with knee-breeches, silk stockings, and
      powdered wigs, were receiving the congregation at the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go in by the west door&mdash;I should like you to see the screen
      to advantage,&rdquo; said Mr. Golightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inside of the church was gorgeous. As far up as the clerestory every
      wall was frescoed, and every timber of the roof was gilded. At the chancel
      end there was a wrought-iron screen of delicate tracery, and the altar was
      laden with gold candlesticks. Above the altar and at either side of it
      were stained glass windows. The morning sun was shining through them and
      filling the chancel with warm splashes of light. Ladies in beautiful
      spring dresses were following the vergers up the aisles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; the curate whispered, and John Storm entered the sacristy by a
      low doorway like the auditorium entrance to a stage. There he met some six
      others of his fellow-curates. They nodded to him and went on arranging
      their surplices. The choir were gathering in their own quarters, where the
      violins were tuning up and the choir boys were laughing and behaving after
      their kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell slackened and stopped, and the organ began to play. When all were
      ready they stepped into a long corridor and formed in line with their
      faces to the chancel and their backs to a little door, at which a verger
      in blue stood guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The canon&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Golightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prayer was said by some one, the choir sang the response, and then they
      walked in procession to their places in the chancel, the choir boys first,
      the canon last. Seen through the tracery of the screen, the congregation
      appeared to fill every sitting in the church with a blaze of light and
      colour, and the atmosphere was laden with delicate perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service was choral. An anthem was sung at the close of the sermon, the
      collection being made during the hymn before it. The professional singer
      looked like any other chorister in his surplice, save for his swarthy face
      and heavy mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canon preached. He wore his doctor&rsquo;s hood of scarlet cloth. His sermon
      was eloquent and literary, and it was delivered with elocutionary power.
      There were many references to great writers, painters, and musicians,
      including a panegyric on Michael Angelo and a quotation from Browning. The
      sermon concluded with a passage from Dante in the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was dazed and perplexed. When the service was over he came out
      alone, returning down the nave, which was now empty but still fragrant.
      Among other notices pasted on a board in the porch he found this one: &ldquo;The
      vicar and wardens, having learned with regret that purses have been lost
      on leaving the church, recommend the congregation to bring only such money
      as they may need for the offertory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had he been to the house of God? No matter! God ruled the world in
      righteousness and wrought out everything to his own glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he began duty as chaplain at the hospital, and when he had
      finished the reading of his first prayers he could see that he had lived
      down some of the derision due to his adventure with the old woman. That
      poor old bag of bones was sinking and could not last much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going out by way of the dispensary, he saw Glory again, and heard that she
      had been at church the day before. It was lovely. All those hundreds of
      nice-looking people in gay colours, with the rustle of silk and the hum of
      voices&mdash;it was beautiful&mdash;it reminded her of the sea in summer.
      He asked her what she thought of the sermon, and she said, &ldquo;Well, it
      wasn&rsquo;t religion exactly&mdash;not what I call religion&mdash;not a
      &lsquo;reg&rsquo;lar rousing rampage for sowls,&rsquo; as old Chalse used to say, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; he said impetuously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to preach my first sermon on
      Wednesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not ask her to come, but inquired if she was on night duty. She
      answered No, and then somebody called her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; he told himself, and he walked home with uplifted head.
      He would look for her; he would catch her eye; she would see that it was
      not necessary to be ashamed of him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then close behind, very close, came recollections of her appearance.
      He could reconstruct her new dress by memory&mdash;her face was easy to
      remember. &ldquo;After all, beauty is a kind of virtue,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;And all
      natural friendship is good for the progress of souls if it is built upon
      the love of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrote nothing and learned nothing by heart. The only preparation he
      made for his sermon was thought and prayer. When the Wednesday night came
      he was very nervous. But the church was nearly empty, and the vergers, who
      were in their everyday clothes, had only partially lit up the nave. The
      canon had done him the honour to be present; his fellow-curates read the
      prayers and lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he ascended the pulpit he thought he saw the white bonnets of a group
      of nurses in the dim distance of one of the aisles, but he did not see
      Glory and he dared not look again. His text was, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of
      this world.&rdquo; He gave it out twice, and his voice sounded strange to
      himself&mdash;so weak and thin in that hollow place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he began to speak his sentences seemed awkward and difficult. The
      things of the world were temporal and the nations of the world were out of
      harmony with God. Men were biting and devouring each other who ought to
      live as brothers. &ldquo;Cheat or be cheated&rdquo; was the rule of life, as the
      modern philosopher had said. On the one side were the many dying of want,
      on the other side the few occupied with poetry and art, writing addresses
      to flowers, and peddling&mdash;in the portraiture of the moods and methods
      of love, living lives of frivolity, taking pleasure in mere riches and the
      lusts of the eye, while thousands of wretched mortals were grovelling in
      the mire.... Then where was our refuge? ... The Church was the refuge of
      God&rsquo;s people ... from Christ came the answer&mdash;the answer&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His words would not flow. He fought hard, threw out another passage, then
      stammered, began again, stammered again, felt hot, made a fresh effort,
      flagged, rattled out some words he had fixed in his mind, perspired, lost
      his voice, and finally stopped in the middle of a sentence and said, &ldquo;And
      now to God the Father&mdash;&rdquo; and came down from the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sermon had been a failure, and he knew it. On going back to the
      sacristy the Reverend Golightly congratulated him with a simper and a
      vapid smile. The canon was more honest but more vain. He mingled lofty
      advice with gentle reproof. Mr. Storm had taken his task too lightly.
      Better if he had written his sermon and read it. Whatever might serve for
      the country, congregations in London&mdash;at All Saints&rsquo; especially&mdash;expected
      culture and preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own part I confess&mdash;nay, I am proud to declare&mdash;my
      watchword is Rehearse! Rehearse! Rehearse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for the doctrine of the sermon it was not above question. It was
      necessary to live in the <i>nineteenth</i> century, and it was impossible
      to apply to its conditions the rules of life that had been proper to the
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm made no resistance. He slept badly that night. As often as he
      dozed off he dreamed that he was trying to do something he could not do,
      and when he awoke he became hot as with the memory of a disgrace. And
      always at the back of his shame was the thought of Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he was alone in his room and fumbling the toast on his
      breakfast table, when the door opened and a cheery voice cried, &ldquo;May I no
      come in, laddie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An elderly lady entered. She was tall and slight and had a long, fine
      face, with shrewd but kindly eyes, and nearly snow-white hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jane Callender,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I couldna wait for an introduction or
      sic bother, but must just come and see ye. Ay, laddie, it was a bonnie
      sermon yon! I havena heard the match of it since I came frae Edinburgh and
      sat under the good Doctor Guthrie. Now <i>he</i> was nae slavish reader
      neither&mdash;none of your paper preachers was Thomas. My word, but you
      gave us the right doctrine, too! They&rsquo;re given over to the worship of
      Beelzebub&mdash;half these church-going folks! Oh, these Pharisees! They
      are enough to sour milk. I wish they had one neck and somebody would just
      squeeze it. Now, where did ye hear that, Jane? But no matter! And the
      lasses are worse than the men, with their fashions and foldololls. They
      love Jesus, but they like him best in heaven, not bothering down in
      Belgravia. But I must be going my ways. I left James on the street, and
      there&rsquo;s nae living with the man if you keep his horses waiting.
      Good-morning til ye! But eh, laddie, I&rsquo;m afraid for ye! I&rsquo;m thinking&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      thinking ... but come and see me at Victoria Square. Good-morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had rattled this off at a breath, and had hardly given time for a
      reply, when her black silk was rustling down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm remembered that the canon had spoken of her. She was the good
      woman who kept the home for girls at Soho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good creature only came to comfort me,&rdquo; he thought. But Glory! What
      was Glory thinking? That morning after prayers at the hospital he went in
      search of her in the out-patient department, but she pretended to be
      overwhelmed with work, and only nodded and smiled and excused herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a moment this morning either for the king or his dog. I&rsquo;m
      up to my eyes in bandages, and have fourteen plasters on my conscience,
      and now I must run away to my little boy whose leg was amputated on
      Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood her, but he came back in the evening and was resolved to
      face it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think of last night, Glory?&rdquo; Then she put on a look of blank
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what happened? Oh, of course, the sermon! How stupid of me! Do you
      know I forgot all about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not there, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. Really, I&rsquo;m ashamed; after my promise to grandfather, too!
      But Wednesday doesn&rsquo;t count anyway, does it? You&rsquo;ll preach on Sunday&mdash;and
      then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His feeling of relief was followed by a sense of deeper humiliation. Glory
      had not even troubled herself to remember. Evidently he was nothing to
      her, nothing; while she&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked home through St. James&rsquo;s Park, and under the tall trees the
      peaceful silence of the night came down on him. The sharp clack of the
      streets was deadened to a low hum as of the sea afar off. Across the
      gardens he could see the clock in the tower of Westminster, and hear the
      great bell strike the quarters. London! How little and selfish all
      personal thoughts were in the contemplation of the mighty city! He had
      been thinking only of himself and his own little doings. It was all so
      small and pitiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did my shame at my failure in the pulpit proceed solely from fear of
      losing the service of God, or did it proceed from wounded ambition, from
      pride, from thoughts of Glory&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the peaceful stars were over him. It was a majestic night.

      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard.
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Auntie Rachel: Tell grandpa, to begin with, that John Storm preached
      his first sermon on Wednesday last, and, according to programme, I was
      there to hear it. Oh, God bless me! What a time I had of it! He broke down
      in the middle, taking stage fright or pulpit fright or some such devilry,
      though there was nothing to be afraid of except a bandboxful of chattering
      girls who didn&rsquo;t listen, and a few old fogies with ear-trumpets. I was
      sitting in the darkness at the back, effectually concealed from the
      preacher by the broad shoulders of Ward Sister Allworthy, who is an
      example of &lsquo;delicate femaleism&rsquo; just verging on old-maidenism. They tell
      me the &lsquo;discoorse&rsquo; was a short one, but I never got so many prayers into
      the time in all my born days, and my breath was coming and going so fast
      that the Sister must have thought they had set up a pumping-engine in the
      pew behind her. Our poor, heavy-laden Mr. Storm has been here since then
      with his sad and eager face, but I hadn&rsquo;t the stuff in me to tell him the
      truth about the sermon, so I told him I had forgotten to go and hear it,
      and may the Lord have mercy on my soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to know how I employ my time? Well, lest you should think I give
      up my days to dreams and my nights to idleness, I hasten to tell that I
      rise at 6, breakfast at 6.30, begin duty at 7, sup at 9.30 P.M., gossip
      till 10, and then go into my room and put myself to bed; and there I am at
      the end of it. Being only a probationer, I am chiefly in the out-patient
      department, where my duties are to collect the things wanted at the
      dispensary, make the patients ready to see the surgeon, and pass them on
      to the dressers. My patients at present are the children, and I love them,
      and shall break my heart when I have to leave them. They are not always
      too well looked after by the surgeon, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter in the
      least, because, you see, they are constantly watched by the best and most
      learned doctor in the world&mdash;that&rsquo;s me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last Saturday I had my first experience of the operating theatre.
      Gracious goodness! I thought I shouldn&rsquo;t survive it. Fortunately, I had my
      dressings and sponges to look after, so I just stiffened my back with a
      sort of imaginary six-foot steel bar, and went on &lsquo;like blazes.&rsquo; But some
      of these staff nurses are just &lsquo;ter&rsquo;ble&rsquo;; they take a professional
      pleasure in descending to that inferno, and wouldn&rsquo;t miss a &lsquo;theatre&rsquo; for
      worlds. On Saturday it was a little boy of five who had his leg amputated,
      and now when you ask the white-faced darling where he&rsquo;s going to he says
      he&rsquo;s going to the angels, and he&rsquo;ll get lots of gristly pork up there. He
      <i>is</i> too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>personnel</i> of our vineyard is abundant, but there are various
      sour grapes growing about. We have a medical school (containing lots of
      nice boys, only a girl may not speak to them even in the corridors), and a
      full staff of honorary and visiting physicians and surgeons. But the only
      doctor we really have much to do with is the house surgeon, a young fellow
      who has just finished his student&rsquo;s course. His name is Abery, and since
      Saturday he has so much respect for Glory that she might even swear in his
      presence (in Manx), but Sister Allworthy takes care that she doesn&rsquo;t,
      having designs on his celibacy herself. He must have sung his <i>Te Deum</i>
      after the operation, for he got gloriously drunk and wanted to inject
      morphia in a patient recovering from trouble of the kidney. It was an old
      hippopotamus of a German musician named Koenig, and he was in a frantic
      terror. So I whispered to him to pretend to go to sleep, and then I told
      the doctor I had lost the syringe. But&mdash;&lsquo;Gough bless me sowl!&rsquo;&mdash;what
      a dressing the Sister gave me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday was visiting-day, and when the friends of the patients come
      even an hospital can have its humours. They try to sneak in little
      dainties which may be delicious in themselves, but are deadly poison to
      the people they are intended for. Then we have to search under the
      bedclothes of the patients, and even feel the pockets of their visitors.
      The mother of my little boy came yesterday, and I noticed such a large
      protuberance at her bosom under her ulster that I began to foresee another
      operation. It was only a brick of currant cake, paved with lemon peel. I
      hauled it out and moved round like a cloud of thunder and lightning. But
      she began to cry and to say she had made it herself for Johnnie, and then&mdash;well,
      didn&rsquo;t I just get a wigging from the Sister, though!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mind what happens here, for I am in London, and to be in
      London is to live, and to live is to be in London. I&rsquo;ve not seen much of
      it yet, having only two hours off duty every day&mdash;from ten to twelve&mdash;and
      then all I can do is to make little dips into the park and the district
      round about, like a new pigeon with its wings clipped. But I watch the
      great new world from my big box up here, and see the carriages in the park
      and the people riding on horseback. They have a new handshake in London.
      You lift your hand to the level of your shoulder, and then waggle
      horizontally as if you had put your elbow out; and when you begin to speak
      you say, &lsquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;&rsquo; as if you had got the mumps. But it is
      beautiful! The sound of the traffic is like music, and I feel like a
      war-horse that wants to be marching to it. How delightful it is to be
      young in a world so full of loveliness! And if you are not very ugly it&rsquo;s
      none the worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All hospital nurses are just now basking in the sunshine of a forthcoming
      ball. It is to be given at Bartimaeus&rsquo;s Hospital, where they have a
      lecture theatre larger than the common, and the dancing there is for once
      to be to a happier tune. All the earth is to be present&mdash;all the
      hospital earth&mdash;and if I could afford to array myself in the
      necessary splendour, I should show this benighted London what an absolute
      angel Glory is! But then my first full holiday is to be on the 24th, when
      I expect to be out from 10 A. M. until 10 P. M. I am nearly crazy whenever
      I think of it, and when the time comes to make my first plunge into
      London, I know I shall hold my breath exactly as if I were taking a header
      off Creg Malin rocks.... Glory.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 24th Glory rose at five, that she might get through
      her work and have the entire day for her holiday. At that hour she came
      upon a rough-haired nurse wearing her cap a little on one side and washing
      a floor with disinfectants. Being in great spirits, Glory addressed her
      cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you off to-day too?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse gave her a contemptuous glance and answered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one of
      your paying probationers, Miss&mdash;playing probationers <i>I</i> call
      them. We nurses are hard-working women, whose life spells duty; and we&rsquo;ve
      got no time for sight-seeing and holiday-making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you are one of those who ruin the profession altogether,&rdquo; said a
      younger woman who had just come up. &ldquo;They will expect everybody to do the
      same. This is my day off, but I have to do the grate, and sweep the ward,
      and make the bed, and tidy the Sister&rsquo;s room&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all through
      people like you. Small thanks you get for it either, for a girl may not
      even wear her hair in a fringe, and she is always expecting to hear the
      matron&rsquo;s &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not fit for nursing, Miss.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory looked at her. She was an exquisitely pretty girl, with dark hair,
      pink and ivory cheeks, and light-gray eyes; but her hands were coarse, and
      her finger nails flat and square, and when you looked again there was a
      certain blemished appearance about her beauty as of a Sèvres vase that is
      cracked somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say you are off to-day?&rdquo; said Glory,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am; are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m strange to London. Could you take me with you&mdash;if you
      are going nowhere in particular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, dear. I&rsquo;ve noticed you before and wanted to speak to you.
      You&rsquo;re the girl with the splendid name&mdash;Glory, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what is yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polly Love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock that morning the two girls set out for their long day&rsquo;s
      jaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now where shall we go?&rdquo; said Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go where we can see a great many people,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy enough, for this is the Queen&rsquo;s birthday, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory thought of Aunt Rachel and made a cry of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that I think of it,&rdquo; said Polly, as if by a sudden memory, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      got tickets for the trooping of the colours&mdash;the Queen&rsquo;s colours, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we see her?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question! Why, no, but we&rsquo;ll see the soldiers, and the generals,
      and perhaps the Prince. It&rsquo;s at ten-thirty, and only across the park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Glory, and she began to drag at her companion and to
      run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious, what a girl you are, to be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they were both running in another minute, and laughing and chattering
      like children escaped from school. In a quarter of an hour they were at
      the entrance to the Horse Guards. There was a crowd at the gates, and a
      policeman was taking tickets. Polly dived into her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are mine? Oh, here they are. A great friend gave me them,&rdquo; she
      whispered. &ldquo;He has a chum in one of those offices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman,&rdquo; said Glory with studied politeness; but they were crushing
      through the gate by that time, and thereafter she had eyes and ears for
      nothing but the pageant before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful morning, and the spring foliage of the park was very
      green and fresh. Three sides of the great square were lined with redcoats;
      the square itself was thronged with people, and every window and balcony
      looking over it was filled. There were soldiers, sentries, policemen, the
      generals in cocked hats, and the Prince himself in a bearskin, riding by
      with the jingle of spurs and curb-chain. Then the ta-ra-ta-ta-ra of the
      bugle, the explosive voice crying, &ldquo;Escort for the colour!&rdquo; the officer
      carrying it, the white gloves of the staff fluttering up the salute, the
      flash of bayonets, the march round, and the band playing The British
      Grenadiers. It was like a dream to Glory. She felt her bosom heaving, and
      was afraid she was going to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly was laughing and prattling merrily. &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! see that soldier
      chasing a sunshade? My! he has caught it with his sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose these are all great people,&rdquo; whispered Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;Do you see that gentleman in the window
      opposite?&mdash;that&rsquo;s the Foreign Office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo; said Glory, but her eyes were wandering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one in the frock-coat and the silk hat, talking to the lady in the
      green lawn and the black lace fichu and the spring bonnet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean beside that plain girl wearing the jungle of rhododendrons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s the gentleman that gave my friend the tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory looked at him for a moment, and something very remote seemed to stir
      in her memory; but the band was playing once more, and she was wafted away
      again. It was God save the Queen this time, and when it ended and
      everybody cried &ldquo;All over!&rdquo; she took a long, deep breath and said, &ldquo;<i>Well!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polly was laughing at her, and Glory had to laugh also. They set each
      other off laughing, and people began to look at them, and then they had to
      laugh again and run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Glory is the funniest girl,&rdquo; said Polly; &ldquo;she is surprised at the
      simplest thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went to look at the shops, passing up Regent Street, across the
      Circus and down Oxford Street toward the City, laughing and talking
      nonsense all the time. Once when they made a little purchase at a shop the
      shopwoman looked astonished at the freedom with which they carried
      themselves, and after that they felt inclined to go into every shop in the
      street and behave absurdly everywhere. In the course of two hours they had
      accomplished all the innocent follies possible to the intoxication of
      youth, and were perfectly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had reached the Bank and were feeling the prickings of
      hunger, so they looked out a restaurant in Cheapside and went in for some
      dinner. The place was full of men, and several of them rose at once when
      the two girls entered. They were in their out-door hospital costume, but
      there was something showy about Polly&rsquo;s toilet, and the men kept looking
      their way and smiling. Glory looked back boldly and said in an audible
      voice, &ldquo;What fun it must be to be a barmaid, and to have the gentlemen
      wink at you, and be laughing back at them!&rdquo; But Polly nudged, her and told
      her to be quiet. She looked down herself, but nevertheless contrived to
      use her eyes as a kind of furtive electric battery in the midst of the
      most innocent conversation. It was clear that Polly had flown farthest in
      the ways of the world, and when you looked at her again you could see that
      the balance of her life had been deranged by some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner the girls got into an omnibus and went still farther east,
      sitting at opposite sides of the car, and laughing and talking loudly to
      each other, amid the astonishment of the other occupants. But when they
      came to mean and ugly streets with green-grocers&rsquo; barrows by the
      curbstone, and weird and dreary cemeteries in the midst of gaunt, green
      sticks that were trying to look like trees, Glory thought they had better
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went back by the Thames steamboat from some landing stage among the
      docks. The steamer picked up passengers at every station on the river, and
      at London Bridge a band came aboard. As they sailed under St. Paul&rsquo;s the
      boat was crowded with people going west to see the celebrations in honour
      of the birthday, and the band was playing And her Golden Hair was hanging
      down her Back.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one moment Glory was wild with delight, and at the next her gaiety
      seemed to be suddenly extinguished. The sun was setting behind the towers
      of Westminster in a magnificent lake of fire, and it seemed like the sun
      going down at Peel, except that the lights beneath, which glistened and
      flashed, were windows, not waves, and the deep hum was not the noise of
      the mighty sea, but the noise of mighty millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They landed at Westminster Bridge and went to a tearoom for tea. When they
      came out it was quite dark, and they got on to the top of an omnibus. But
      the town was now ablaze with gas and electric lights that were flinging
      out the initials of the Queen, and Whitehall was dense with carriages
      going to the official receptions. Glory wanted to be in the midst of so
      much life, so the girls got down and walked arm in arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed through Piccadilly Circus they were laughing again, for the
      oppression of the crowds made them happy. The throng was greatest at that
      point and they had to push their way through. Among others there were many
      gaily-dressed women, who seemed to be waiting for omnibuses. Glory noticed
      that two of these women, who were grimacing and lisping, had spoken to a
      man who was also lounging about. She tugged at Polly&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange! Did you see that?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That! Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s done every day,&rdquo; said Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;well, this, Glory&mdash;&mdash; Really
      your friends ought to take care of you, my dear, you are so ignorant of
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly, as by a flash of lightning, Glory had her first glimpse
      of the tragic issues of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my gracious! Come along,&rdquo; she whispered, and dragged Polly after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were panting past the end of St. James&rsquo;s Street when a man with an
      eye-glass and a great shield of shirt-front collided with them and saluted
      them. Glory was for forging ahead, but Polly had drawn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only my friend,&rdquo; said Polly in another voice.&mdash;&ldquo;This is a new
      nurse. Her name is Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man said something about a glorious name and a glorious pleasure to be
      nursed by such a nurse, and then both the girls laughed. He was glad they
      had found his tickets useful, but sorry he could not see them back to the
      hospital, being dragged away to the bally Foreign Office reception in
      honour of the Queen&rsquo;s birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m coming to the ball, you know, and,&rdquo; with a glance at Glory, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      half a mind to bring my chum along with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do,&rdquo; said Polly, partly covering the pupils of her eyes with her
      eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man lowered his voice and said something about Glory which Glory did
      not catch, then waved his white-kid glove, saying &ldquo;Ta-ta,&rdquo; and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married! Good gracious, no; what ridiculous ideas you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was ten minutes after ten as the girls turned in at a sharp trot at the
      door of the hospital, still prattling and chattering and bringing some of
      the gaiety and nonsense of their holiday into the quiet precincts of the
      house of pain. The porter shook his finger at them with mock severity, and
      a ward Sister going through the porch in her white silence stopped to say
      that a patient had been crying out for one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&mdash;I know it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a brother here out
      of a monastery, and he can&rsquo;t do with anybody else about him. It makes me
      tired of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was Glory who was wanted. The woman whom John Storm had picked up
      out of the streets was dying. Glory had helped to nurse her, and the poor
      old thing had kept herself alive that she might deliver to Glory her last
      charge and message. She could see nobody, so Glory leaned over the bed and
      spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, mammie; what is it?&rdquo; she said, and the flushed young face bent
      close above the withered and white one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke to me friendly and squeedged my &lsquo;and, he did. S&rsquo;elp me never,
      it&rsquo;s true. Gimme a black cloth on the corfin, my dear, and mind yer tell
      &lsquo;im to foller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mammie, yes. I will-be sure I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Glory&rsquo;s first death.

      IX.

    <p>
      John Storm had been through his first morning call that afternoon. For
      this ordeal he had presented himself in a flannel shirt in the hall, where
      the canon was waiting for him in patent-leather boots and kid gloves, and
      his daughter Felicity in cream silk and white feathers. After they had
      seated themselves in the carriage the canon, said: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t quite do
      yourself justice, Mr. Storm. Believe me, to be well dressed is a great
      thing to a young man making his way in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped at a house that seemed to be only round the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mrs. Macrae&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the canon whispered. &ldquo;An American lady-widow of a
      millionaire. Her daughter&mdash;you will see her presently&mdash;is to
      marry into one of our best English families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking up the wide staircase behind the footman in blue. There
      was a buzz of voices coming from a room above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canon&mdash;er&mdash;Wealthy, Miss Wealthy, and&mdash;er&mdash;the&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;Rev.
      Mr. Storm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The buzz of voices abated, and a bright-faced little woman, showily
      dressed, came forward and welcomed them with a marked accent. There were
      several other ladies in the room, but only one gentleman. This person, who
      was standing, with teacup and saucer in hand, at the farther side, screwed
      an eyeglass in his eye, looked across at John Storm, and then said
      something to the lady in the chair beside him. The lady tittered a little.
      John Storm looked back at the man, as if by an instinctive certainty that
      he must know him when he saw him again. He was engulfed in a high, stiff
      collar, and was rather ugly; tall, slender, a little past thirty; fair,
      with soft, sleepy eyes, and no life in his expression, but agreeable; fit
      for good society, with the stamp of good breeding, and capable of saying
      little humorous things in a thin &ldquo;roofy&rdquo; voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was real sorry I didn&rsquo;t hear Mr. Storm Wednesday evening,&rdquo; Mrs. Macrae
      was saying, with a mincing smile. &ldquo;My daughter told me it was just too
      lovely.&mdash;Mercy, this is your great preacher. Persuade him to come to
      my &lsquo;At Home&rsquo; Tuesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall, dark girl, with gentle manners and a beautiful face, came slowly
      forward, put her hand into John&rsquo;s, and looked steadily into his eyes
      without speaking. Then the gentleman with the eyeglass said suavely, &ldquo;Have
      you been long in London, Mr. Storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two weeks,&rdquo; John answered shortly, and half turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;er&mdash;interesting!&rdquo; with a prolonged drawl and a little cold
      titter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord Robert Ure&mdash;Mr. Storm,&rdquo; said the hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Storm has done me the honour to become one of my assistant clergy,
      Lord Robert,&rdquo; said the canon, &ldquo;but he is not likely to be a curate long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is charming,&rdquo; said Lord Robert. &ldquo;It is always a relief to hear that
      I am likely to have one candidate the less for my poor perpetual curacy in
      Pimlico. They&rsquo;re at me like flies round a honey-pot, don&rsquo;t you know. I
      thought I had made the acquaintance of all the perpetual curates in
      Christendom. And what a sweet team they are, to be sure! The last of them
      came yesterday. I was out, and my friend Drake&mdash;Drake of the Home
      Office, you know&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t give the man the living, so he gave him
      sixpence instead, and the creature went away quite satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody seemed to laugh except John, who only stared into the air, and
      the loudest laughter came from the canon. But suddenly an incisive voice
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why sharpen your teeth on the poor curates? Is there no a canon or a
      bishop handy that&rsquo;s better worth a bite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Callender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell ye a story too, only <i>mine</i> shall be a true one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane! Jane!&rdquo; said the hostess, shaking her fan as a weapon; and Lord
      Robert stretched his neck over his collar and made an amiable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl of eighteen came to me this morning at Soho, and she was in the
      usual trouble. The father was a wicked rector. He died last year leaving
      thirty-one thousand pounds; and the mother of his unfortunate child&mdash;that
      is to say, his mistress&mdash;is now in the Union.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first sincere word that had been spoken, where every tone had
      been wrong, every gesture false, and it fell on the company like a
      thunderclap. John Storm drew his breath hard, looked up at Lord Robert by
      a strange impulse, and felt himself avenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful day it has been!&rdquo; said somebody. Everybody looked up at
      the maker of this surprising remark. It was a lady, and she blushed until
      her cheeks burned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A painful silence followed, and then the hostess turned to Lord Robert and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of your friend Drake, didn&rsquo;t you? Everybody is talking of him,
      and as for the girls, they seem to be crazy about the man. So handsome,
      they say; so natural, and such a splendid talker. But then, girls are so
      quick to take fancies to people. You really must take care of yourself, my
      dear.&rdquo; (This to Felicity.) &ldquo;Who is he? Lord Robert will tell you&mdash;an
      official of some kind, and son of Sir something Drake, of one of the
      northern counties. He knows the secret of getting on in the world, though
      he doesn&rsquo;t go about too much. But I&rsquo;ve determined not to live any longer
      without making the acquaintance of this wonderful being, so Lord Robert
      must just bring him along Tuesday evening, or else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm escaped at last, without promising to come to the &ldquo;At Home.&rdquo; He
      went direct to the hospital and learned that Glory was out for the day.
      Where she could have gone, and what she could be doing, puzzled him
      grievously. That she had not put herself under his counsel and direction
      on her first excursion abroad hurt his pride and wounded his sense of
      responsibility. As the night fell his anxiety increased. Though he knew
      she would not return until ten, he set out at nine to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a venture he took the eastward course, and passed slowly down
      Piccadilly. The façade of nearly every club facing the park was flaming
      with electric light. Young men in evening dress were standing on the
      steps, smoking and taking the air after dinner, and pretty girls in showy
      costumes were promenading leisurely in front of them. Sometimes, as a girl
      passed, she looked sharply up and the corner of her mouth would be raised
      a little, and when she had gone by there would be a general burst of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s blood boiled, and then his heart sank; he felt so helpless, his
      pity and indignation were so useless and unnecessary. All at once he saw
      what he had been looking for. As he went by the corner of St. James&rsquo;s
      Street he almost ran against Glory and another nurse in the costume of
      their hospital. They did not observe him; they were talking to a man; it
      was the man he had met in the afternoon&mdash;Lord Robert Ure.
    </p>
    <p>
      John heard the man say, &ldquo;Your Glory is such a glorious&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and
      then he lowered his voice, and appeared to say something that was very
      amusing, for the other girl laughed a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s soul was now fairly in revolt, and he wanted to stop, to order the
      man off and to take charge of the two nurses as his duty seemed to require
      of him. But he passed them, then looked back and saw the group separate,
      and as the man went by he watched the girls going westward. There was a
      glimpse of them under the gas-lamp as they crossed the street, and again a
      glimpse as they passed into the darkness under the trees of the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not trust himself to return to the hospital that night, and his
      indignation was no less in the morning. But there was a letter from Glory
      saying that his poor old friend was dead, and had begged that he would
      bury her. He dressed himself in his best (&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t take liberties with
      the poor,&rdquo; he thought) and walked across to the hospital at once. There he
      asked for Glory, and they went downstairs together to that still chamber
      underground which has always its cold and silent occupant. It is only a
      short tenancy that anybody can have there, so the old woman had to be
      buried the same morning. The parish was to bury her, and the van was at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing with Glory in the hall, and his heart had softened to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t have gone out yesterday without telling
      me, the dangers of London are so great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dangers?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to a young girl, a beautiful girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory peered up under her long eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the dangers from&mdash;I&rsquo;m ashamed in my soul to say it&mdash;the
      dangers from men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shot up a quick glance into his face and said in a moment, &ldquo;You saw
      us, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw you, and I didn&rsquo;t like your choice of company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her head demurely and said, &ldquo;The man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John hesitated. &ldquo;I was speaking of the girl. I don&rsquo;t like the freedom with
      which she carries herself in this house. Among these good and devoted
      women is there no one but this&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s lower lip began to show its inner side. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s bright and lively,
      that&rsquo;s all I care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not all <i>I</i> care, Glory, and if such men as that are her
      friends outside&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s head went up. &ldquo;What is it to me who are her friends outside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything, if you allow yourself to meet them again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; doggedly, &ldquo;I am going to meet them again. I&rsquo;m going to the Nurses&rsquo; 
      Ball on Tuesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John answered with deliberation, &ldquo;Not in that girl&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say <i>not</i> in that girl&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a short pause, and then Glory said with a quivering mouth: &ldquo;You
      are vexing me, and you will end by making me cry. Don&rsquo;t you see you are
      degrading me too? I am not used to being degraded. You see me with a weak
      silly creature who hasn&rsquo;t an idea in her head and can do nothing but
      giggle and laugh and make eyes at men, and you think I&rsquo;m going to be led
      away by her. Do you suppose a girl can&rsquo;t take care of herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will, then,&rdquo; said John, with a fling of his hand, going off down
      the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Storm&mdash;Mr. Storm&mdash;Jo&mdash;Joh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was out on the pavement and getting into the workhouse van.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said a mincing voice beside her. &ldquo;How jolly it is when anybody is
      suffering for your sake!&rdquo; It was Polly Love, and again her eyelids were
      half covering her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said Glory. Her own eyes were
      swimming in big tear-drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? What a funny girl you are! But your education has been
      neglected, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a combination van and hearse with the coffin under the driver&rsquo;s
      box, and John Storm (as the only discoverable mourner) with the undertaker
      on the seat inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will ye be willin&rsquo; ter tyke the service at the cimitery, sir?&rdquo; said the
      undertaker, and John answered that he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave was on the paupers&rsquo; side, and when the undertaker, with his man,
      had lowered the coffin to its place, he said, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gimme abart three
      more funerals this morning, so I&rsquo;ll leave ye now, sir, to finish &lsquo;er off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment John Storm in his surplice was alone with the dead, and
      had opened his book to read the burial service which no other human ear
      was to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read &ldquo;Dust to dust, ashes to ashes,&rdquo; and then the bitter loneliness of
      the pauper&rsquo;s doom came down on his soul and silenced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his imprisoned passion had to find a vent, and that night he wrote to
      the Prime Minister: &ldquo;I begin to understand what you meant when you said I
      was in the wrong place. Oh, this London, with its society, its worldly
      clergy, its art, its literature, its luxury, its idle life, all built on
      the toil of the country and compounded of the sweat of the nameless poor!
      Oh, this &lsquo;Circe of cities,&rsquo; drawing good people to it, decoying them,
      seducing them, and then turning them into swine! It seems impossible to
      live in the world and to be spiritually-minded. When I try to do so I am
      torn in two.&rdquo;

    <p>
      On the following Tuesday evening two young men were dining in their
      chambers in St. James&rsquo;s Street. One of them was Lord Robert Ure; the other
      was his friend and housemate, Horatio Drake. Drake was younger than Lord
      Robert by some seven or eight years, and also beyond comparison more
      attractive. His face was manly and handsome, its expression was open and
      breezy; he was broad-shouldered and splendidly built, and he had the fair
      hair and blue eyes of a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their room was a large one, and it was full of beautiful and valuable
      things, but the furniture was huddled about in disorder. A large
      chamber-organ, a grand piano, a mandolin, and two violins, pictures on the
      floor as well as on the walls, many photographs scattered about
      everywhere, and the mirror over the mantelpiece fringed with
      invitation-cards, which were stuck between the glass and the frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their man had brought in the coffee and cigarettes. Lord Robert was
      speaking in his weary drawl, which had the worn-out tone of a man who had
      made a long journey and was very sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, dear boy, make up your mind, and let us be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m tired to death of these fashionable routs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so unnatural&mdash;so unnecessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, of course they&rsquo;re unnatural&mdash;of course they&rsquo;re
      unnecessary; but what would you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything human and natural,&rdquo; said Drake. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth about
      the morality of these things&mdash;not I&mdash;but I am dead sick of their
      stupidity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert made languid puffs of his cigarette, and said, in a tearful
      drawl: &ldquo;My dear Drake, of course it is exactly as you say. Who doesn&rsquo;t
      know it is so? It has always been so and always will be. But what refuge
      is there for the poor leisured people but these diversions which you
      despise? And as for the poor titled classes&mdash;well, they manage to
      make their play their business sometimes, don&rsquo;t you know. Confess that
      they do sometimes, now, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert was laughing with an awkward constraint, but Drake looked
      frankly into his face and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that matter going on, Robert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly, I think, though the girl is not very hot on it. The thing came
      off last week, and when it was over I felt as if I had proposed to the
      girl and been accepted by the mother, don&rsquo;t you know. I believe this rout
      to-night is expressly in honour of the event, so I mustn&rsquo;t run away from
      my bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lay back, sent funnels of smoke to the ceiling, and then said, with a
      laugh like a gurgle: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not likely to, though. That eternal dun was here
      again to-day. I had to tell him that the marriage would come off in a year
      certain. That was the only understanding on which he would agree to wait
      for his money. Bad? Of course it&rsquo;s bad; but what would you have, dear
      boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men smoked in silence for a moment, and then Lord Robert said again:
      &ldquo;Come, old fellow, for friendship&rsquo;s sake, if nothing else. She&rsquo;s a decent
      little woman, and dead bent on having you at her house to-night. And if
      you&rsquo;re badly bored we&rsquo;ll not stay long. We&rsquo;ll come away early and&mdash;listen&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
      slip across to the Nurses&rsquo; Ball at Bartimaeus&rsquo;s Hospital; there&rsquo;ll be fun
      enough there, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the two young men were driving up to the door of Mrs.
      Macrae&rsquo;s house in Belgrave Square. There was a line of carriages in front
      of it, and they had to wait their turn to approach the gate. Footmen in
      gorgeous livery were ready to open the cab door, to help the guests across
      the red baize that lay on the pavement, to usher them into the hall, to
      lead them to the little marble chamber where they entered their names in a
      list intended for the next day&rsquo;s <i>Morning Post</i>, and finally to
      direct them to the great staircase where the general crush moved slowly up
      to the saloon above.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the well of the stairs, half hidden behind a little forest of palms and
      ferns, a band in yellow and blue uniform sat playing the people in. On the
      landing the hostess stood waiting to receive, and many of the guests, by a
      rotary movement like the waters of a maelstrom, moved past her in a rapid
      and babbling stream, twisted about her, and came down again. She welcomed
      Lord Robert effusively, and motioned to him to stand by her side. Then she
      introduced her daughter to Drake and sent them adrift through the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooms were large ones with parquet flooring from which all furniture
      had been removed, except the palms and ferns by the walls and the heavy
      chandeliers overhead. It was not yet ten o&rsquo;clock, but already the house
      was crowded, and every moment there were floods of fresh arrivals. First
      came statesmen and diplomatists, then people who had been to the theatres,
      and toward the end of the evening some of the actors themselves. The night
      was close and the atmosphere hot and oppressive. At the farther end of the
      suite there was a refreshment-room with its lantern lights pulled open;
      and there the crush was densest and the commotion greatest. The
      click-clack of many voices cut the thick air as with a thousand knives,
      and over the multitudinous clatter there was always the unintelligible
      boom of the band downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the guests looked tired. The men made some effort to be cheerful,
      but the women were frankly jaded and fagged. Bedizened with diamonds,
      coated with paint and powder, laden with rustling silks, they looked weary
      and worn out. When spoken to they would struggle to smile, but the smiles
      would break down after a moment into dismal looks of misery and
      oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had enough?&rdquo; whispered Lord Robert to Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake was satisfied, and Lord Robert began to make their excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going already!&rdquo; said Mrs. Macrae. &ldquo;An official engagement, you say?&mdash;Mr.
      Drake, is it? Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me! I know&mdash;<i>I</i> know! Well, you&rsquo;ll
      be married and settled one of these days&mdash;and then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were in a hansom cab driving across London in the direction of
      Bartimaeus&rsquo;s Hospital. Drake was bare-headed and fanning himself with his
      crush hat. Lord Robert was lighting a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! What a stifling den! Did you ever hear such a clitter-clatter? A
      perfect Tower of Babel building company! What in the name of common sense
      do people suppose they&rsquo;re doing by penning themselves up like that on a
      night like this? What are they thinking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking about, dear boy? You&rsquo;re unreasonable! Nobody wants to think
      about anything in such scenes of charming folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the women! Did you <i>ever</i> see such faded, worn-out dummies for
      the display of diamonds? Poor little women in their splendid misery! I was
      sorry for your <i>fiancée</i>, Robert. She was the only woman in the house
      without that hateful stamp of worldliness and affectation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Drake, you&rsquo;ve learned many things, but there&rsquo;s one thing you have
      not yet learned&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t learned how to take serious things as
      trifles, and trifles as serious things. Learn it, my boy, or you&rsquo;ll
      embitter existence. You are not going to alter the conditions of
      civilization by any change in your own particular life; so just look out
      the prettiest, wittiest, wealthiest little woman who is a dummy for the
      display of diamonds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Not if I know it, old fellow! Give me a little nature and simplicity,
      if it hasn&rsquo;t got a second gown to its back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;as you like,&rdquo; said Lord Robert, flinging out the end of
      his cigarette. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the pull of some of us&mdash;you can please
      yourself. And here we are at old Bartimaeus&rsquo;s, and this is a very
      different pair of shoes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were driving out of one of London&rsquo;s main thoroughfares, through a
      groined archway, into one of London&rsquo;s ancient buildings with its quiet
      quadrangle where trees grow and birds sing. Every window of the square was
      lighted up, and there was a low murmur of music being played within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Lord Robert. &ldquo;I am here ostensibly as the guest of the
      visiting physician, don&rsquo;t you know, but really in the interests of the
      little friend I told you of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one I got the tickets for last week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment they were in the ballroom. It was the lecture theatre
      for the students of the hospital school&mdash;a building detached from the
      wards and of circular shape, with a gallery round its walls, which were
      festooned with flags and roofed with a glass dome. Some two hundred girls
      and as many men were gathered there; the pit was their dancing ring and
      the gallery was their withdrawing room. The men were nearly all students
      of the medical schools; the girls were nearly all nurses, and they wore
      their uniform: There was not one jaded face among them, not one weary look
      or tired expression. They were in the fulness of youth and the height of
      vigour. The girls laughed with the ring of joy, their eyes sparkled with
      the light of happiness, their cheeks glowed with the freshness of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men stood a moment and looked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rdquo; said Lord Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake&rsquo;s wide eyes were ablaze, and his voice came in gusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful! It&rsquo;s glorious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert&rsquo;s glass had dropped from his eye, and he was laughing in his
      drawling way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at? Women like these are at least natural, and
      Nature can not be put on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mazurka had just finished, and the dancers were breaking into groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert, tell me who is that girl over there&mdash;the one looking this
      way? Is it your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert readjusted his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pretty dark girl with the pink-and-white cheeks, like a doll?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and the taller one beside her&mdash;all hair, and eyes, and bosom.
      She&rsquo;s looking across now. I&rsquo;ve seen that girl before somewhere. Now, where
      have I seen her? Look at her&mdash;what fire, and life, and movement! The
      dance is over, but she can&rsquo;t keep her feet still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see&mdash;I see. But let me introduce you to the matron and doctors
      first, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know now&mdash;I know where I&rsquo;ve seen her! Be quick, Robert, be quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert laughed again in his tired drawl. He was finding it very
      amusing.

    <h2>
      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Glory learned that all nurses eligible to attend the ball were to
      wear hospital uniform, being on day duty she decided to go to it. But then
      came John Storm&rsquo;s protest against the company of Polly Love, and she felt
      half inclined to give it up. As often as she remembered his remonstrance
      she was disturbed, and once or twice when alone she shed tears of anger
      and vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Polly was full of arrangements, and Glory found herself day by
      day carried along in the stream of preparation. When the night came the
      girls dressed in the same cubicle. Polly was prattling like a parrot, but
      Glory was silent and almost sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      By help of the curling tongs and a candle Polly did up her dark hair into
      little knowing curls that went in and out on her temples and played
      hide-and-seek around the pretty shells of her pink-and-white ears. Glory
      was slashing the comb through her golden-red hair by way of preliminary
      ploughing, when Polly cried: &ldquo;Stop! Don&rsquo;t touch it any more, for goodness&rsquo; 
      sake! It&rsquo;s perfect! Look at yourself now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory stood off from the looking glass and looked. &ldquo;Am I really so nice?&rdquo;
       she thought; and then she remembered John Storm again, and had half a mind
      to tear down her glorious curls and go straight away to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the ball instead, and, being there, she forgot all about her
      misgivings. The light, the colour, the brilliance, the perfume transported
      her to an enchanted world which she had never entered before. She could
      not control her delight in it. Everything surprised her, everything
      delighted her, everything amused her&mdash;she was the very soul of
      girlish joy. The dark-brown spot on her eye shone out with a coquettish
      light never seen in it until now, and the warble in her voice was like the
      music of a happy bird. Her high spirits were infectious&mdash;her
      lighthearted gaiety communicated itself to everybody. The men who might
      not dance with her were smiling at the mere sight of the sunshine in her
      face, and it was even whispered about that the President of the College of
      Surgeons, who opened the ball, had said that her proper place was not
      there&mdash;a girl like that young Irish nurse would do honour to a higher
      assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that enchanted world of music and light and bright and happy faces
      Glory lost all sense of time; but two hours had passed when Polly Love,
      whose eyes had turned again and again to the door, tugged at her sleeve
      and whispered: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve come at last! There they are&mdash;there&mdash;directly
      opposite to us. Keep your next dance, dear. They&rsquo;ll come across
      presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory looked where Polly had directed, and, seeing again the face she had
      seen in the window of the Foreign Office, something remote and elusive
      once more stirred in her memory. But it was gone in a moment, and she was
      back in that world of wonders, when a voice which she knew and yet did not
      know, like a voice that called to her as she was awakening out of a sleep,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory, don&rsquo;t you remember me? Have you forgotten me, Glory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was her friend of the catechism class&mdash;her companion of the
      adventure in the boat. Their hands met in a long hand-clasp with the
      gallop of feeling that is too swift for thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I thought you would recognise me! How delightful!&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you knew me again?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instantly&mdash;at first sight almost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! It&rsquo;s strange, though. Such a long, long time&mdash;ten years at
      least! I must have changed since then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have,&rdquo; said Drake; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve changed very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed now! Am I really so much changed for all? I&rsquo;ve grown older, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, terribly older,&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wrong of me! But you have changed a good deal, too. You were only a
      boy in jackets then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were only a girl in short frocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed, and then Drake said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad we&rsquo;ve changed
      together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Drake; &ldquo;for if you had changed and I hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what nonsense we&rsquo;re talking!&rdquo; said Glory; and they both laughed
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they told each other what had happened in that infinite cycle of time
      which had spun round since they parted. Glory had not much to narrate; her
      life had been empty. She had been in the Isle of Man all along, had come
      to London only recently, and was now a probationer-nurse at Martha&rsquo;s
      Vineyard. Drake had gone to Harrow and thence to Oxford, and, being a man
      of artistic leanings, had wished to take up music, but his father had seen
      no career in it; so he had submitted&mdash;he had entered the subterranean
      catacombs of public life, and was secretary to one of the Ministers. All
      this he talked of lightly, as became a young man of the world to whom
      great things were of small account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; said Polly, at her elbow, &ldquo;the waltz is going to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The band was preluding. Drake claimed the dance, and Glory was astonished
      to find that she had it free (she had kept it expressly).
    </p>
    <p>
      When the waltz was over he gave her his arm and led her into the circular
      corridor to talk and to cool. His manners were perfect, and his voice, so
      soft and yet so manly, increased the charm. In passing out of the hot
      dancing room she threw her handkerchief over her head, and, with the hand
      that was at liberty, held its ends under her chin. She wished him to look
      at her and see what change this had made; so she said, quite innocently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now let me look at you again, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He recognised the dark-brown spot on her eye, and he could feel her arm
      through her thin print dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me a good deal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you haven&rsquo;t said a syllable
      about the most important thing of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what is that?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times have you fallen in love since I saw you last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, what a question!&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      His audacity was delightful. There was something so gracious and yet so
      masterful about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the day you carried me off&mdash;eloped with me, you
      know?&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? How charming of me! But when was that, I wonder?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; say, do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I do? What a pair of little geese we must have been in those
      days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that&mdash;<i>now</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t seem very keen about me <i>then</i>, as far as I can
      remember,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What a silly young fool I must have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed again. She could not keep her arm still, and he could almost
      feel its dimpled elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do <i>you</i> remember the gentleman who rescued us?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the tall, dark young man who kept hugging and kissing you in the
      yacht?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you forget that kind of thing, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very sweet of him. But he&rsquo;s in the Church now, and the chaplain of
      our hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a funny little romantic world it is, to be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s like poetry, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert came up to introduce Drake to Polly (who was not looking her
      sweetest), and he claimed Glory for the next dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you knew my friend Drake before?&rdquo; said Lord Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him when he was a boy,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he began to sing his friend&rsquo;s praises&mdash;how he had taken a
      brilliant degree at Oxford, and was now private secretary to the Home
      Secretary, and would go into public life before long; how he could paint
      and act, and might have made a reputation as a musician; how he went into
      the best houses, and was a first-rate official; how, in short, he had the
      promised land before him, and was just on the eve of entering it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose you know he is rich&mdash;enormously rich?&rdquo; said Lord
      Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; said Glory, and something great and grand seemed to shimmer a
      long way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enormously,&rdquo; said Sir Robert; &ldquo;and yet a man of the most democratic
      opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lord Robert; &ldquo;and all the way down in the hansom he has been
      trying to show me how impossible it is for him to marry a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now why did you tell me that I wonder?&rdquo; said Glory, and Lord Robert began
      to fidget with his eye-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake returned with Polly. He proposed that they should take the air in
      the quadrangle, and they went off for that purpose, the girls arm-in-arm
      some paces ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dash of Satan himself in that red-headed girl,&rdquo; said Lord
      Robert. &ldquo;She understands a man before he understands himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s as natural as Nature,&rdquo; said Drake. &ldquo;And what lips&mdash;what a
      mouth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irish, isn&rsquo;t she? Oh, Manx! What&rsquo;s Manx, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night was very warm and close, and there was hardly more air in the
      courtyard. The sound of the band came to them there, and Glory, who had
      danced with nearly everybody within, must needs dance by herself without,
      because the music was more sweet and subdued out there, and dancing in the
      darkness was like a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit down on the seat, Glory,&rdquo; said Polly fretfully; &ldquo;you are
      getting on my nerves, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; said Drake, &ldquo;how do the Londoners strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much like other mortals,&rdquo; said Glory; &ldquo;no better, no worse&mdash;only
      funnier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men laughed at that description, and Glory proceeded to give
      imitations of London manners&mdash;the high handshake, the &ldquo;Ha-ha&rdquo; of the
      mumps, the mouthing of the canon, and the mincing of Mr. Golightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake bellowed with delight; Lord Robert drawled out a long owlish laugh;
      Polly Love said spitefully, &ldquo;You might give us your friend, the new
      curate, next, dearest,&rdquo; and then Glory went down like a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; began Drake, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not hospital nursing, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there were low murmurings of thunder and some large splashes of rain,
      and they returned to the ballroom. The doctors and the matrons were gone
      by this time; only the nurses and the students remained, and the fun was
      becoming furious. One young student was pulling down a girl&rsquo;s hair, and
      another was waltzing with his partner carried bodily in his arms. Somebody
      lowered the lights, and they danced in a shadow-land; somebody began to
      sing, and they all sang in chorus; then somebody began to fling about
      paper bags full of tiny white wafers, and the bags burst in the air like
      shells, and their contents fell like stars from a falling rocket, and
      everybody was covered as with flakes of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the storm had broken, and above the clash and clang of the
      instruments of the band and the rhythmic shuffle of the feet of the
      dancers and the clear, joyous notes of their happy singing, there was the
      roar of the thunder that rolled over London, and the rattle of the rain on
      the glass dome overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory was in ecstasies; it was like a mist on Peel Bay at night with the
      moon shining through it and the waves dancing to a northwest breeze. It
      was like a black and stormy sea outside Contrary, with the gale coming
      down from the mountains. And yet it was a world of wonder and enchantment
      and beauty, and bright and happy faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was morning when the ball broke up, and then the rain had abated,
      though the thunder was still rumbling. The men were to see the girls back
      to the hospital, and Glory and Drake sat in a hansom-cab together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you always forget that kind of thing, do you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of thing?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; <i>you</i> know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had put up the hood of her outdoor cape, but he could still see the
      gleam of her golden hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that rose,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the white one that you put in your hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give it to me. I&rsquo;ll keep it forever and ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put up her hand to her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how sweet of you! And what a lovely little hand! But no; let me take
      it for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached one arm around her shoulder, put his hand under her chin,
      tipped up her face, and kissed her on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in a moment she awoke from her world of wonder and enchantment, and
      the intoxication of the evening left her. She did not speak; her head
      dropped; she felt her cheeks burn red, and she hid her face in her hands.
      There was a momentary sense of dishonour, almost of outrage. Drake treated
      her lightly, and she was herself to blame.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Glory!&rdquo; he was saying, in a voice tremulous and intense. &ldquo;It
      shall never happen again&mdash;never&mdash;so help me God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day was dawning, and the last raindrops were splashing on the wet and
      empty pavement. The great city lay asleep, and the distant thunder was
      rolling away from it.

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The chaplain of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard had not been to the hospital ball.
      Before it came off he had thought of it a good deal, and as often as he
      remembered that he had protested to Glory against the company of Polly
      Love he felt hot and ashamed. Polly was shallow and frivolous, and had a
      little crab-apple of a heart, but he knew no harm of her. It was hardly
      manly to make a dead set at the little thing because she was foolish and
      fond of dress, and because she knew a man who displeased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was Glory&rsquo;s only companion, and to protest against Glory going in
      her company was to protest against Glory going at all. That seemed a
      selfish thing to do. Why should he deny her the delights of the ball? He
      could not go to it himself&mdash;he would not if he could; but girls liked
      such things&mdash;they loved to dance, and to be looked at and admired,
      and have men about them paying court and talking nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sting in that thought, too; but he struggled to be
      magnanimous. He was above all mean and unmanly feelings&mdash;he would
      withdraw his objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not withdraw it. Some evil spirit whispered in his heart that Glory
      was drifting away from him. This was the time to see for certain whether
      she had passed out of the range of his influence. If she respected his
      authority she would not go. If she went, he had lost his hold of her, and
      their old relations were at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the ball he walked over to the hospital and asked for her.
      She had gone, and it seemed as if the earth itself had given way beneath
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not help feeling bitterly about Polly Love, and that caused him
      to remember a patient to whom her selfish little heart had shown no
      kindness. It was her brother. He was some nine or ten years older, and
      very different in character. His face was pale and thin&mdash;almost
      ascetic&mdash;and he had the fiery and watery eyes of the devotee. He had
      broken a blood-vessel and was threatened with consumption, but his case
      was not considered dangerous. When Polly was about, his eyes would follow
      her round the ward with something of the humble entreaty of a dog. It was
      clear that he loved his sister, and was constantly thinking of her. But
      she hardly ever looked in his direction, and when she spoke to him it was
      in a cold or fretful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had observed this. It had brought him close to the young man,
      and the starved and silent heart had opened out to him. He was a
      lay-brother in an Anglican Brotherhood that was settled in Bishopsgate
      Street. His monastic name was Brother Paul. He had asked to be sent to
      that hospital because his sister was a nurse there. She was his only
      remaining relative. One other sister he had once had, but she was gone&mdash;she
      was dead&mdash;she died&mdash;&mdash; But that was a sad and terrible
      story; he did not like to talk of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this broken and bankrupt creature John Storm found his footsteps
      turning on that night when his own heart lay waste. But on entering the
      ward he saw that Brother Paul had a visitor already. He was an elderly man
      in a strange habit&mdash;a black cassock which buttoned close at the neck
      and fell nearly to his feet, and was girded about the waist by a black
      rope that had three great knots at its suspended ends. And the habit was
      not more different from the habit of the world than the face of the wearer
      was unlike the worldly face. It was a face full of spirituality, a face
      that seemed to invest everything it looked upon with a holy peace&mdash;a
      beautiful face, without guile or craft or passion, yet not without the
      signs of internal strife at the temples and under the eyes; but the
      battles with self had all been fought and won.
    </p>
    <p>
      As John Storm stepped up, the old man rose from his chair by the patient&rsquo;s
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the Father Superior, sir,&rdquo; said Brother Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been hearing of you,&rdquo; said the Father in a gentle voice. &ldquo;You
      have been good to my poor brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm answered with some commonplace&mdash;it had been a pleasure, a
      happiness; the brother would soon leave them; they would all miss him&mdash;perhaps
      himself especially.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father resumed his chair and listened with an earnest smile. &ldquo;I
      understand you, dear friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is so much more blessed to give
      than to receive! Ah, if the poor blind world only knew! How it fights for
      its pleasures that perish, and its pride of life that passes away! Yet to
      succour a weaker brother, or protect a fallen woman, or feed a little
      child will bring a greater joy than to conquer all the kingdoms of the
      earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm sat down on the end of the bed. Something had gone out to him
      in a moment, and he was held as by a spell. The Father talked of the love
      of the world&mdash;how strange it was, how difficult to understand, how
      tragic, how pitiful! The lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye&mdash;how
      mean, how delusive, how treacherous! To think of the people of that mighty
      city day by day and night by night making themselves miserable in order
      that they might make themselves merry; to think of the children of men
      scouring the globe for its paltry possessions, that could not add one inch
      to the stature of the soul, while all the time the empire of peace and joy
      and happiness lay here at hand, here within ourselves, here in the little
      narrow compass of the human heart! To give, not to get, that was the great
      blessedness, and to give of yourself, of your heart&rsquo;s love, was the
      greatest blessedness of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was stirred. &ldquo;The Church, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Church itself has
      to learn that lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he spoke of the hopes with which he had come up to London, and
      how they were being broken down and destroyed; of his dreams of the Church
      and its mission, and how they were dying or dead already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What liars we are, sir! How we colour things to justify ourselves! Look
      at our sacraments&mdash;are they a lie, or are they a sacrilege? Look at
      our charities&mdash;are we Pharisees or are we hypocrites? And our clergy,
      sir&mdash;our fashionable clergy! Surely some tremendous upheaval will
      shake to its foundations the Church wherein such things are possible&mdash;a
      Church that is more worldly than the world! And then the woman-life of the
      Church, see how it is thrown away. That sweetest and tenderest and holiest
      power, how it goes to waste under the eye and with the sanction of the
      Church in the frivolities of fashion&mdash;in drawing-rooms, in gardens,
      in bazars, in theatres, in balls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. His last word had arrested him. Had he been thinking only of
      himself and of Glory? His head fell and he covered his face with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my son,&rdquo; said the Father quietly, &ldquo;and yet you are wrong,
      too. The Church of God will not be shaken to its foundations because of
      the Pharisees who stand in its public places, or because of the publicans
      who haunt its purlieus. Though the axe be laid to the rotten tree, yet the
      little seed will save its kind alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then with an earnest smile and in a gentle voice he spoke of their little
      brotherhood in Bishopsgate Street; how ten years ago they had founded it
      for detachment from earthly cares and earthly aims, and for hiddenness
      with God; how they had established it in the midst of the world&rsquo;s, busiest
      highway, in the heart of the world&rsquo;s greatest market, to show that they
      despised gold and silver and all that the blind and cheated world most
      prizes, just as St. Philip and St. Ignatius had established the severest
      of modern rules in a profane and self-indulgent century, to show that they
      could stamp out every suggestion of the flesh as a spark from the fires of
      hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he lifted his cord and pointed to the knots at the end of it, and
      told what they were&mdash;symbols of the three bonds by which he was bound&mdash;the
      three vows he had taken: the vow of poverty, because Christ chose it for
      himself and his friends; the vow of obedience, because he had said, &ldquo;He
      that heareth you heareth Me&rdquo;; and the vow of chastity, because it was our
      duty to guard the gates of the senses, and to keep our eyes and ears and
      tongue from all inordinateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lawful love of home and kindred,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;what of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We convert it into what is spiritual,&rdquo; said the Father. &ldquo;All human love
      must be based on the love of God if it is to be firm and true and
      enduring, and the reason of so much failure of love in natural friendship
      is that the love of the creature is not built upon the love of the
      Creator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the love&mdash;say of mother and son&mdash;of brother and sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, we have placed ourselves above the ordinary conditions of life that
      none may claim our affections in the same way as Christ. Man has to
      contend with two sets of enemies&mdash;those from within and those from
      without; and no temptations are more subtle than those which come in the
      name of our holiest affections. But the sword of the spirit must keep the
      tempter away. There is the Judas in all of us, and he will betray us with
      a kiss if he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s breast was heaving. He could scarcely conceal his agitation;
      but the Father had risen to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is eight o&rsquo;clock, and I must be back to Compline,&rdquo; he said. And then
      he laughed and added: &ldquo;We never ride in cabs; but I must needs walk across
      the park to-night, for I have given away all my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that the smile of an angel came into his old face, and lie said, with a
      sweet simplicity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love the park. Every morning the children play there, and then it is
      the holy Catholic Church to me, and I like to walk in it and to lay my
      hands on the heads of the little ones, and to ask a blessing for them, and
      to empty my-self. This morning as I was coming here I met a little boy
      carrying a bundle. &lsquo;And what is <i>your</i> name, my little man?&rsquo; I said,
      and he told me what it was. &lsquo;And how old are you?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Twelve
      years,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;And what have you got in your bundle?&rsquo; &lsquo;Father&rsquo;s
      dinner, sir,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;And what is your father, my son?&rsquo; &lsquo;A carpenter,&rsquo; 
      said the boy. And I thought if I had been living in Palestine nineteen
      hundred years ago I might have met another little Boy carrying the dinner
      of his father, who was also a carpenter, in a little bundle which Mary had
      made up for him. So I felt in my pocket, and all I had was my fare home
      again, and I gave it to the little man as a thank-offering to God that he
      had suffered me to meet a sweet boy of twelve whose father was a
      carpenter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s eyes were dim with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Brother Paul, and God send you back to us soon!&mdash;Good-bye
      to you, dear friend; and when the world deals harshly with you come to us
      for a few days in Retreat, that in the silence of your soul you may forget
      its vanities and vexations and fix your thoughts above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm could not resist the impulse&mdash;he dropped to his knees at
      the Father&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me also, Father, as you blessed the carpenter&rsquo;s boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father raised two fingers of his right hand and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, my son, and be with you and strengthen you, and when he
      smiles on you may the frown of man affect you not!&mdash;Father in heaven,
      look down on this fiery soul and succour him! Help him to cast off every
      anchor that holds him to the world, and make him as a voice crying in the
      wilderness, &lsquo;Come out of her, my people, saith our God.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When John rose from his knees the saintly face was gone, and all the air
      seemed to be filled with a heavenly calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he had been kneeling for the Father&rsquo;s blessing he had been aware of
      a step on the floor behind him. It was his fellow-curate, the Reverend
      Golightly, who was still waiting to deliver his message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canon had been disappointed in one of his preachers for Sunday, and
      being himself engaged to preside over the annual dinner of a dramatic
      benevolent fund to be held on the Saturday night, and therefore incapable
      of extra preparation, he desired that Mr. Storm should take the sermon on
      Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      John promised to do so; and then his fellow-curate smiled, bowed, coughed,
      and left him. A small room was kept for the chaplain on the ground floor
      of the hospital, and he went down to it and wrote a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to the parson at Peel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you hear from Glory frequently, and know all about her progress
      as a probationer. She seems to be very well, and certainly I have never
      seen her look so bright and so cheerful. At the moment of writing she is
      out at a ball given by some of the hospital authorities. Well, it is a
      perfectly harmless source of pleasure, and with all my heart I hope she is
      enjoying herself. No doubt some form of amusement is necessary to a young
      girl in the height of her youth and health and beauty, and he would be
      only a poor sapless man who could not take delight in the thought that a
      good girl was happy. Her fellow-nurses, too, are noble and devoted women,
      doing true woman&rsquo;s work, and if there are some black sheep among them,
      that is no more than might be expected of the purest profession in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for myself, I have tried to carry out-my undertaking to look after
      Glory, but I can not say how long I may be able to continue the task. Do
      not be surprised if I am compelled to give it up. You know I am
      dissatisfied with my present surroundings, and I am only waiting for the
      ruling and direction of the pillar of cloud and fire. God alone can tell
      how it will move, but God will guide me. I don&rsquo;t go out more than I can
      help, and when I do go I get humiliated and feel foolish. The life of
      London has been a great and painful surprise. I had supposed that I knew
      all about it, but I have really known nothing until now. Its cruelty, its
      deceit, and its treachery are terrible. London is the Judas that is
      forever betraying with a kiss the young, the hopeful, the innocent.
      However, it helps one to know one&rsquo;s self, and that is better than lying
      wrapped in cotton wool. Give my kindest greetings to everybody at Glenfaba&mdash;my
      love to my father, too, if there are any means of conveying it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter took him long to write, and when it was written he went out
      into the hall to post it. There he saw that a thunderstorm was coming, and
      he concluded to remain until it had passed over. He stepped into the
      library and selected a book, and returned to his room to read it. The book
      was St. John Chrysostom on the Priesthood, and the subject was congenial,
      but he could not keep his mind on the printed page: He thought of the
      Father Superior, of the little brotherhood in Bishopsgate, and then of
      Glory at the hospital ball, and again of Glory, and yet again and again of
      Glory. Do what he would, he could not help but think of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm pealed over his head, and when he returned to the hall two hours
      later it was still far from spent. He stood at the open door and watched
      it. Forks of lightning lit up the park, and floods of black rain made the
      vacant pavements like the surface of the sea. A tinkling cab slid past at
      intervals, with its driver sheeted in oilskins, and now and then there was
      an omnibus, full within and empty without. Only one other living thing was
      to be seen anywhere. An Italian organ-man had stationed himself in front
      of a mansion to the left and was playing vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm walked through the hospital. It was now late, and the house was
      quiet. The house-doctor had made the last of his rounds and turned into
      his chambers across the courtyard, and the night-nurses were boiling
      little kettles in their rooms between the wards. The surgical wards were
      darkened, and the patients were asleep already. In the medical wards there
      were screens about certain of the beds, and weary moans came from behind
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after midnight when John Storm came round to the hall again, and
      then the rain had ceased, but the thunder was still rumbling. He might
      have gone home at length, but he did not go; he realized that he was
      waiting for Glory. Other nurses returned from the ball, and bowed to him
      and passed into the house. He stepped into the porter&rsquo;s lodge, and sat
      down and watched the lightning. It began to be terrible to him, because it
      seemed to be symbolical. What doom or what disaster did this storm typify
      and predict? Never could he forget the night on which it befell. It was
      the night of the Nurses&rsquo; Ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought he must have slept, for he shook himself and thought: &ldquo;What
      nonsense! Surely the soul leaves the body while we are asleep, and only
      the animal remains!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now almost daylight, and two hansom-cabs had stopped before the
      portico, and several persons who were coming up the steps were chattering
      away like wakened linnets. One voice was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Drake proposes that we should all go to the theatre, and if we can
      get a late pass I should like it above everything.&rdquo; It was Glory, and a
      fretful voice answered her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, if <i>you</i> say so. It&rsquo;s all the same to <i>me</i>.&rdquo; It was
      Polly; and then a man&rsquo;s voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What night shall it be, then, Robert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a second man&rsquo;s voice answered, with a drawl, &ldquo;Better let the girls
      choose for themselves, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm felt his hands and feet grow cold, and he stepped out into the
      porch. Glory saw him coming and made a faint cry of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here is Mr. Storm! Mr. Storm, you should know Mr. Drake. He was in
      the Isle of Man, you remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do <i>not</i> remember,&rdquo; said John Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you saved his life, and you ought to know him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do <i>not</i> know him,&rdquo; said John Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was beginning to say, &ldquo;Let me introduce&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But she stopped
      and stood silent for a moment, while the strange light came into her
      gleaming eyes of something no word could express, and then she burst into
      noisy laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A superintendent Sister going through the hall at the moment drew up and
      said, &ldquo;Nurse, I am surprised at you! Go to your rooms this instant!&rdquo; and
      the girls whispered their adieus and went off giggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a glorious night it has been!&rdquo; said Glory, going upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so,&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I found it
      dreadfully tiresome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men lit their cigarettes and got back into one of the hansoms and
      drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a bear that man is!&rdquo; said Lord Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rude enough, certainly,&rdquo; said Drake; &ldquo;but I liked his face for all that;
      and if the Fates put it into his head to stand between me and death&mdash;well,
      I&rsquo;m not going to forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him a wide berth, dear boy. The fellow is an actor&mdash;an affected
      fop. I met him at Mrs. Macrae&rsquo;s on Thursday. He is a religious actor and a
      poseur. He&rsquo;ll do something one of these days, take my word for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile John Storm had buttoned his long coat up to his throat and
      was striding home through the echoing streets, with both hands clinched
      and his teeth set hard.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martha&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord-a-massy! Oh, Gough bless me sowl! Oh, my beloved grandfather!
      John Storm has done for himself at last! That man was never an author of
      peace and a lover of concord; but, my gracious, if you had heard his
      sermon in church on Sunday morning! Being a holy and humble woman of heart
      myself, I altered the Litany the smallest taste possible, and muttered
      away from beginning to end, &lsquo;O Lord, close thou our lips&rsquo;; but the Lord
      didn&rsquo;t heed me in the least, with the result that everybody on earth is
      now screaming and snarling at our poor Mr. Storm exactly as if he had been
      picking the pockets of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all about the morality of men. The text was as innocent as a baby:
      &lsquo;Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to
      fulfil the lusts thereof.&rsquo; And when he began in the usual way, the dear
      old goodies in glasses thought he had been wound up like the musical box
      and had just turned on the crank, so they cuddled in comfortably for forty
      winks before the anthem. There were two natures in man, and man&rsquo;s body
      might be good or bad according as spiritual or carnal affections swayed
      it, and all the rest of the good old
      change-for-sixpence-and-a-ha&rsquo;penny-out, you know. But the lesson had been
      from Isaiah, where the unreasonable old prophet is indignant with the
      ladies of Zion because they don&rsquo;t want to look like dowdies, you remember:
      &lsquo;Tremble, ye women that are at ease, strip you and make you bare and gird
      sackcloth upon your loins.&rsquo; And off he went like a comet, with the
      fashionable woman for his tail. If matrimony nowadays didn&rsquo;t always mean
      monogamy, who was chiefly to blame? Men were generally as pure as women
      required that they should be; and if the lives of men were bad it was
      often because women did not demand that they should be good. Tremble, ye
      women, that are at ease, and say why you allow your daughters to marry men
      who in fact and effect are married already. Strip you, and be ashamed for
      the poor women who were the first wives of your daughters&rsquo; husbands, and
      for the children whom such men abandon and forget! In leading your
      innocent daughters to courts and receptions you are only leading them to
      the auction-room; and in dressing and decorating them you are preparing
      them for the market of base men. Last week some titled philanthropist had
      hauled up a woman in the East End of London for attempting to sell her
      daughter. How shocking! everybody said. What a disgrace to the nineteenth
      century! But the wretched creature had only been doing the best according
      to her light for the welfare of her miserable child; while here&mdash;with
      their eyes open, with their cultured consciences&mdash;the wives of these
      same philanthropists were doing the same thing every day&mdash;the very
      same!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having gone for the mammies like this, he went for the dear girls
      themselves one better. Let them gird sackcloth on their loins and hide
      their faces. Why did they suffer themselves to be sold? The woman who
      married a man for the sake of his title or his position or any worldly
      advantage whatever was no better than an outcast of the streets. Her act
      was the same, and in all reason and justice her name should be the same
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, nonny, nonny! I told you how he broke down before; but on Sunday
      morning, in spite of mine own amended Litany, I had just as much hope of
      the breakdown of the Falls of Niagara, or a nineteen-feet spring tide. You
      would have said his face was afire, and those great eyes of his were lit
      up like the red lamps on Peel pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pulpit oratory! I don&rsquo;t know what it is, only I never heard the like of
      it in all my born days. I begin to think the real difference between
      preachers is the difference of the fire beneath the crust. In some it
      burns so low that it doesn&rsquo;t even warm the surface, and you couldn&rsquo;t get
      up enough puff to boil the kitchen kettle; but in others&mdash;look out!
      It&rsquo;s a volcano, and the lava is coming down with a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy me, how I cried! &lsquo;Oh, my daughter, oh, my child, what a ninny you
      are!&rsquo; I told myself; but it was no use talking. His voice was as hoarse as
      a raven&rsquo;s, and sometimes you would have thought his very heart was
      breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the congregation! You should have seen the transformation scene! They
      had come in bowing and smiling and whispering softly until the church was
      a perfect sheet of sunshine, an absolute aurora borealis; but they went
      out like a northeast gale, with mutterings of thunder and one man
      overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And John Storm having put his foot in it, of course Glory Quayle had to
      get her toe in too. Coming down the aisle some of the dear ladies of Zion,
      who looked as if they wanted to &lsquo;swear in their wrath,&rsquo; were mumbling all
      the lamentations of Jeremiah. Who was he, indeed, to talk to people like
      that? Nobody had ever heard of him except his mother. And in the porch
      they came upon a fat old dump in a velvet dollman who declared it was
      perfectly scandalous, and she had come out in the middle. Whereupon Glory,
      not being delivered that day from all evil and mischief, said, &lsquo;Quite
      right, ma&rsquo;am, and you were not the only one who had to leave the church in
      the middle of that sermon.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, who else had to go?&rsquo; said this female
      Pharisee. &lsquo;The devil, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; said Glory, and then left her with that bone
      to gnaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It turns out that the old girlie in the dollman is a mighty patron of
      this hospital, so everybody says I am in for nasty weather. But hoot! My
      heart&rsquo;s in the Hielan&rsquo;s, my heart is not here; my heart&rsquo;s in the Hielan&rsquo;s,
      sae what can I fear!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Storm is in for it too, and they say his vicar waited for him in the
      vestry, but he looked like forked lightning coming out of the pulpit, so
      the good man thought it better to keep his rod in pickle awhile. It seems
      that the Lords of the Council and all the nobility were there, and it is a
      point of religious etiquette in London that in the hangman&rsquo;s house nobody
      speaks of the rope; but our poor John gave them the gibbet as well. It was
      a fearful thing to do, but nobody will make me believe he had not got his
      reasons. He hasn&rsquo;t been here since, but I am certain he has his eye on
      some fine folks, and, whoever they are, I&rsquo;ll bet &lsquo;my bottom dollar&rsquo; they
      deserved all they got.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But heigho! I haven&rsquo;t left myself breath to tell you about the ball. I
      was there! You remember I was lamenting that I hadn&rsquo;t got the necessary
      finery. In fact, I had put in a bit at the end of my prayers about it. &lsquo;O
      God, be good to me this once and let me look nice.&rsquo; And he <i>was</i>. He
      put it into the heads of the nabobs of this vineyard that nurses should
      &lsquo;appear at the Nurses&rsquo; Ball in regulation uniform only.&rsquo; So my cloak and
      my bonnet and my gray dress and my apron covered a multitude of sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have seen Glory that night, grandfather. She was a redder
      young lobster than ever somehow, but she put a white rose in her carroty
      curls, and, Gough bless me, what a bogh [* Dear] she was, though! Of
      course, she made the acquaintance of the &lsquo;higher ranks of society,&rsquo; and
      danced with all the earth. The great surgeon of something opened the ball
      with the matron of Bartimaeus&rsquo;s, and she went round on his arm like a
      dolly in a dolly-tub; but he soon saw what a marvellous and miraculous
      being Glory was, and after I had waltzed so beautifully with the ancient
      personage I had the hearts of all the young men flying round at the hem of
      my white petticoat&mdash;it was a nice new one for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the strangest thing was that somebody from the Isle of Man flopped
      down on me there just as if he had descended from the blue. It was that
      little English boy Drake, who used to come to the catechism class, only
      now he is one of the smartest and handsomest young men in London. When he
      came up and announced himself I am sure he expected me to expire on the
      spot or else go crazy, and of course I was trembling all over, but I
      behaved like a rational person and stood my ground. He looked at me as
      much as to say, &lsquo;Do you know you&rsquo;ve grown to be a very fine young woman,
      and I admire you very much?&rsquo; Whereupon I looked back as much as to reply,
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s quite right, my dear young sir, and I should have a poor opinion
      of you if you didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; So, being of the same opinion on the only subject
      worth thinking about (that&rsquo;s me), I behaved charmingly to him, and even
      forgave him when he carried off my white rose at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Drake has a friend who is always with him. He is a willowy person who
      owns sixteen setters and three church livings, they say, and wears (on
      week days) a thunder-and-lightning suit of clothes&mdash;<i>you</i> know,
      a pattern so large that one man can&rsquo;t carry the whole of it and somebody
      else goes about with the rest. His name is Lord Robert Ure, and I intend
      to call him Lord Bob, for, since he is such a frivolous person himself, I
      must make a point of being severe. I danced with him, of course, and he
      kept telling me what a wonderful future Mr. Drake had, and how the
      Promised Land was before him, and even hinting that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad
      thing to be Mrs. Joshua. Fancy Glory making a tremendous match with a
      leader of society! And if I hadn&rsquo;t gone to that hospital ball no doubt the
      history of the nineteenth century would have been different!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are going to take me next week to something far, far better than a
      ball, only I must not tell you anything about it yet, except that I keep
      awake all night sometimes to think of it. But thou sure and firmest earth,
      hear not my steps which way they walk!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late, and I&rsquo;m just going to cuddle in. Good-night! My kisses for the
      aunties, and my love to everybody! In fact, you can serve out my love in
      ladles this time&mdash;being cheap at present, and plenty more where this
      is coming from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot to tell you what happened when we returned to the hospital!
      It was shockingly late, and the gentlemen had brought us back, but there
      was our John Storm with his sad and anxious face waiting up to see us
      safely home. He was angry with me, and I didn&rsquo;t mind that in the least;
      but when I saw that he liked me well enough to be rude to the gentlemen I
      fell a victim to the crafts and assaults of the devil, and couldn&rsquo;t help
      laughing out loud; and then Ward Sister Allworthy came along and lifted
      her lip and showed me her tusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a wonderful night altogether, and I was never so happy in my life,
      but all the same I had a good cry to myself alone before going to bed. Too
      much water hadst thou, poor Ophelia! Talk about two natures in one; I&rsquo;ve
      got two hundred and fifty, and they all want to do different things! Ah
      me! the &lsquo;ould Book&rsquo; says that woman was taken out of the rib of a man, and
      I feel sometimes as if I want to get back to my old quarters. Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll write you a full and particular account of the great
      event of next week after it is over. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest
      chuck, till thou applaud the deed. You see I don&rsquo;t want you to eat your
      meal in fear&mdash;or your porridge either. But I am burning with
      impatience for the night to come, and would like to run to it. Oh, if it
      were done, when &lsquo;tis done, then &lsquo;twere well it were done quickly! See? I
      am going in for a course of Shakespeare!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week later Glory made her first visit to the theatre. Her companions
      were Drake, who was charmed with her <i>naïveté</i>; Lord Robert, who was
      amused by it; and Polly Love, who was annoyed and ashamed, and uttered
      little peevish exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the box which they were to occupy, the attendant drew back
      the curtain, and at sight of the auditorium she cried, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and then
      checked herself and coloured deeply. With her eyes down she sat where
      directed in one of the three seats in front, Polly being on her right and
      Drake on her left, and Lord Robert at the back of the lace curtain. For
      some minutes she did not smile or stir, and when she spoke it was always
      in whispers. A great awe seemed to have fallen upon her, and she was
      behaving as she behaved in church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake began to explain the features of the theatre. Down there were the
      stalls, and behind the stalls was the pit. The body? Well, yes&mdash;the
      body, so to speak. And the three galleries were the dress circle, the
      family circle, and the gallery proper. The organ loft? No, there was no
      organ, but that empty place below was the well for the orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is this little vestry?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is a private box where we can sit by ourselves and talk!&rdquo; said
      Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every other explanation she had made little whispered cries of
      astonishment and delight; but when she heard that conversation was not
      forbidden she was entirely happy. She thought a theatre was even more
      beautiful than a church, and supposed an actor must have a wonderful
      living.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was filling rapidly, and as the people entered she watched them
      intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful congregation!&rdquo; she whispered&mdash;&ldquo;audience, I mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Polly; but Glory did not hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was delightful to see so many lovely faces and listen to the low hum of
      their conversation. She felt happy among them already and quite kind to
      everybody, because they had all come together to enjoy themselves.
      Presently she bowed to some one in the stall with a face all smiles, and
      then said to Polly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice of her! A lady moved, to me from the body. How friendly they are
      in theatres!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was to Mr. Drake,&rdquo; said Polly; and then Glory could have buried
      her face in her confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Glory,&rdquo; said Drake; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a lady who will like you the
      better for the little mistake.&mdash;Rosa,&rdquo; he added, with a look toward
      Lord Robert, who smoothed his mustache and bent his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly glanced up quickly at the mention of the name; and Drake explained
      that Rosa was a friend of his own&mdash;a lady journalist, Miss Rosa
      Macquarrie, a good and clever woman. Then, turning back to Glory, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been standing up for your friend Mr. Storm this week. You know
      there have been attacks upon him in the newspapers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she?&rdquo; said Glory, recovering herself and looking down again. &ldquo;Which
      pew&mdash;stall, I mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the people were clapping their hands and turning their faces to the
      opposite side of the theatre. Some great personage was entering the royal
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My chief, the Home Secretary,&rdquo; said Drake; and, when the applause had
      subsided and the party were seated, the great man recognised his secretary
      and bowed to him; whereupon it seemed to Glory that every face in the
      theatre turned about and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not flinch, but bore herself bravely. There was a certain thrill
      and a slight twitching of the head, such as a charger makes at the first
      volley in battle&mdash;nothing more, not even the quiver of an eyelid.
      This was the atmosphere in which Drake lived, and she felt a vague
      gratitude to him for allowing her to move in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it beautiful!&rdquo; she whispered, turning toward Polly; but Polly&rsquo;s
      face was hidden behind the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchestra was coming in, and Glory leaned forward and counted the
      fiddles, while Drake talked with Lord Robert across her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found him reading Rosa&rsquo;s article this morning, and it seems he was
      present himself and heard the sermon,&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s his opinion?&rdquo; asked Lord Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much the same as your own. Affectation&mdash;the man is suffering from
      the desire to be original&mdash;more egotism than love of truth, and so
      forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, too, dear boy. All this vapouring is as much as to say: &lsquo;Look at
      me! I am the Hon. and Rev. Mr. Thingamy, nephew of the Prime Minister; and
      yet&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t at all agree with the chief,&rdquo; said Drake, &ldquo;and I told him so. The
      man has enthusiasm, and that&rsquo;s the very salt of the earth at present. We
      are all such pessimists in these days! Thank God for anybody who will warm
      us up with a little faith, say I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s bosom heaved, and she was just about to speak, when, there was a
      sudden clap as of thunder, and she leaped up in her seat. But it was only
      the beginning of the overture, and she sat down laughing. There was a
      tender passage in the music; and after it was over she was very quiet for
      a while, and then whispered to Polly that she hoped little Johnnie wasn&rsquo;t
      worse to-night, and it seemed wicked to enjoy one&rsquo;s self when any one was
      so poorly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little boy whose leg was amputated,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Glory is so funny!&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;Fancy talking of that here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Lord Robert; &ldquo;the curtain is going up.&rdquo; And at the next
      moment Glory was laughing because they were all in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play was Much Ado about Nothing, and Glory whispered to Drake that she
      had never seen it before, but she had read Macbeth, and knew all about
      Shakespeare and the drama. The first scene took her breath away, being so
      large and so splendid. It represented the outside of a gentleman&rsquo;s house,
      and she thought what a length of time it must have taken to build it,
      considering it was to last only a single night. But hush! The people were
      going indoors. No; they preferred to talk in the street. Oh, we were in
      Italy? Yes, indeed, that was different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonato delivered his first speeches forcibly, and was rewarded with
      applause. Glory clapped her hands also, and said he was a very good actor
      for such a very old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Beatrice made her entrance, and was greeted with cheers, whereupon
      Glory looked perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Terry,&rdquo; whispered Polly; and Drake said, &ldquo;Ellen Terry&rdquo;; but Glory
      still looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are calling her &lsquo;Beatrice,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. Then, mastering the
      situation, she looked wise and said: &ldquo;Of course&mdash;the actress&mdash;I
      quite understand; but why do they applaud her&mdash;she has done nothing
      yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake explained that the lady playing Beatrice was a great favourite, and
      that the applause of the audience had been of the nature of a welcome to a
      welcome guest, as much as to say they had liked her before, and were glad
      to see her again. Glory thought that was beautiful, and, looking at the
      gleaming eyes that shone out of the darkness, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely to be an actress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned back to the stage, where all was bright and brilliant, and
      said, &ldquo;What a lovely frock, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a stage costume, my dear,&rdquo; said Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what beautiful diamonds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paste,&rdquo; said Lord Robert,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Drake; and then Benedick entered, and the audience received
      him with great cheering. &ldquo;Irving,&rdquo; whispered Drake; and Glory looked more
      perplexed than before and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you told me it was Mr. Irving&rsquo;s theatre, and I thought it would have
      been his place to welcome&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vision of Benedick clapping his hands at his own entrance set Lord
      Robert laughing in his cold way: but Drake said, &ldquo;Be quiet, Robert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory, like a child, had ears for no conversation except her own, and she
      was immersed in the play in a moment. The merry war of Beatrice and
      Benedick had begun, and as she watched it her face grew grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s very foolish of her,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and if, as you say, she&rsquo;s a
      great actress, she shouldn&rsquo;t do such things. To talk like that to a man is
      to let everybody see that she likes him better than anybody else, though
      she&rsquo;s trying her best to hide it. The silly girl&mdash;he&rsquo;ll find her
      out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the curtain had gone down on the first act, the lights had suddenly
      gone up, and her companions were laughing at her. Then she laughed also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s only a play,&rdquo; she said largely, &ldquo;and I know all about
      plays and about acting, and I can act myself, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can,&rdquo; said Polly, lifting her lip. But Glory took no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the second act she put on the same airs of knowledge, watching
      the masked ball intently, but never once uttering a laugh and hardly ever
      smiling. The light, the colour, the dresses, the gay young faces enchanted
      her; but she struggled to console herself. It was only her body that was
      up there, leaning over the front of the box with lips twitching and eyes
      gleaming; her soul was down on the stage, clad in a lovely gown, and
      carrying a mask and laughing and joking with Benedick; but she held
      herself in, and when the curtain fell she began to talk of the acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still of the opinion that Leonato was excellent for such an
      elderly gentleman, and when Polly praised Claudio she agreed that he was
      good too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Benedick is my boy for all,&rdquo; she said. In some way she had identified
      herself with Beatrice, and hardly ever spoke of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the third act this air of wisdom and learning broke down badly. In
      the middle of the ballad, &ldquo;Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,&rdquo; she
      remembered Johnnie, and whispered to Drake how ill he had been when they
      left the hospital. And when it was over, and Benedick protested that the
      song had been vilely sung, she sat back in her seat and said she didn&rsquo;t
      know how Mr. Irving could say such a thing, for she was sure the boy had
      sung it beautifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the author,&rdquo; whispered Drake; and then she said wisely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know&mdash;Shakespeare, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the liming of the two love-birds, and she declared that
      everybody was in love in plays of that sort, and that was why she liked
      them; but as for those people playing the trick, they were very simple if
      they thought Beatrice didn&rsquo;t know she loved Benedick. Claudio fell
      woefully in her esteem in other respects also, and when he agreed to spy
      on Hero she said he ought to be ashamed of himself anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ridiculous you are!&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the author, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the author ought to be ashamed of himself, also, for it is unjust
      and cruel and unnecessary,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain had come down again by this time, and the men were deep in an
      argument about morality in art, Lord Robert protesting that art had no
      morality, and Drake maintaining that what Glory said was right, and there
      was no getting to the back of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fourth act witnessed Glory&rsquo;s final vanquishment. When she found
      the scene was the inside of a church and they were to be present at a
      wedding, she could not keep still on her seat for delight; but when the
      marriage was stopped and Claudio uttered his denunciation of Hero, she
      said it was just like him, and it would serve him right if nobody believed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said somebody near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are believing him,&rdquo; said Glory quite audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Hush!&rdquo; came from many parts of the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s shameful&mdash;her father, too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Glory!&rdquo; whispered Drake; but she had risen to her feet, and when
      Hero fainted and fell she uttered a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a girl!&rdquo; whispered Polly. &ldquo;Sit down&mdash;everybody&rsquo;s looking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a play, you know,&rdquo; whispered Drake; and Glory sat down and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes; of course, it&rsquo;s only a play. Did you suppose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was lost in a moment. Beatrice and Benedick were alone in the
      church now; and when Beatrice said, &ldquo;Kill Claudio,&rdquo; Glory leaped up again
      and clapped her hands. But Benedick would not kill Claudio, and it was the
      last straw of all. That wasn&rsquo;t what she called being a great actor, and it
      was shameful to &ldquo;sit and listen to such plays. Lots of disgraceful scenes
      happened in life, but people didn&rsquo;t come to the theatre to see such
      things, and she would go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ridiculous you are!&rdquo; said Polly; but Glory was out in the corridor,
      and Drake was going after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came back at the beginning of the fifth act with red eyes and confused
      smiles, looking very much ashamed. From that moment onward she cried a
      good deal, but gave no other sign until the green curtain came down at the
      end, when she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful thing! To make people forget it&rsquo;s not true is the most
      wonderful thing in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert, standing behind the curtain at the back of Polly&rsquo;s chair, had
      been laughing at Glory with his long owlish drawl, and making cynical
      interjections by way of punctuating her enthusiasm; and now he said,
      &ldquo;Would you like to have a nearer view of your wonderful world, Glory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory looked perplexed, and Drake muttered, &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Robert!&rdquo;
       Then, turning to Glory, he said shortly: &ldquo;He only asked if you would like
      to go behind the scenes; but I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory uttered a cry of delight. &ldquo;Like it? Better than anything in the
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must take you to a rehearsal somewhere,&rdquo; said Lord Robert; &ldquo;and
      you&rsquo;ll both come to tea at the chambers afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake made some show of dissent; but Polly, with her most voluptuous look
      upward, said it would be perfectly charming, and Glory was in raptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls, by their own choice, went home without escort by the
      Hammersmith omnibus. They sat on opposite sides and hardly talked at all.
      Polly was humming idly. &ldquo;Sigh no more, ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory was in a trance. A great, bright, beautiful world had that night
      swum into her view, and all her heart was yearning for it with vague and
      blind aspirations. It might be a world of dreams, but it seemed more real
      than reality, and when the omnibus passed the corner of Piccadilly Circus
      she forgot to look at the women who were crowding the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The omnibus drew up for them at the door of the hospital, and they took
      long breaths as they went up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the corridor to the surgical ward they came upon John Storm. His head
      was down and his step was long and measured, and he seemed to be trying to
      pass them in his grave silence; but Glory stopped and spoke, while Polly
      went on to her cubicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here so late?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked steadily into her face and answered, &ldquo;I was sent for&mdash;some
      one was dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it little Johnnie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not a tear now, not a quiver of an eyelid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I care for this life,&rdquo; she said fretfully. &ldquo;Death is always
      about you everywhere, and a girl can never go out to enjoy herself but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true woman&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; said John hotly, &ldquo;the truest, noblest work a
      woman can have in all the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Glory, swinging on her heel. &ldquo;All the same&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; said John, and he turned on his heel also.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked after him and laughed. Then with a little hard lump at her
      heart she took herself off to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly Love, in the next cubicle, was humming as she undressed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
  Men were deceivers ever.
</pre>
    <p>
      That night Glory dreamed that she was back at Peel. She was sitting up on
      the Peel hill, watching the big ships as they weighed anchor in the bay
      beyond the old dead castle walls, and wishing she were going out with them
      to the sea and the great cities so far away.

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Storm was sitting in his room next morning fumbling the leaves of a
      book and trying to read, when a lady was announced. It was Miss Macrae,
      and she came in with a flushed face, a quivering lip, and the marks of
      tears in her eyes. She held his hand with the same long hand-clasp as
      before, and said in a tremulous voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ashamed of coming, and mother does not know that I am here; but I am
      very unhappy, and if you can not help me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; said John Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she said, and then her sad eyes
      moved about the room and came back to his face. &ldquo;It is about Lord Robert
      Ure, and I am very wretched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me everything, dear lady, and if there is anything I can do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him all. It was a miserable story. Her mother had engaged her to
      Lord Robert Ure (there was no other way of putting it) for the sake of his
      title, and he had engaged himself to her for the sake of her wealth. She
      had never loved him, and had long known that he was a man of scandalous
      reputation; but she had been taught that to attach weight to such
      considerations would be girlish and sentimental, and she had fought for a
      while and then yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will reproach me for my feebleness,&rdquo; she said, and he answered
      haltingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not reproach you&mdash;I pity you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is all over now, and if I am ruined, and if my
      mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have told her you can not marry him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who am I to reproach you?&rdquo; he said; and rising to his feet, he threw
      down his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dark eyes wandered about the room, and came back to his face again and
      shone with a new lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard your sermon on Sunday, Mr. Storm, and I felt as if there were
      nobody else in the church, and you were speaking to me alone. And last
      night at the theatre&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been tramping the room, but he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him in a box with his friend and two&mdash;two ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were they nurses from the hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a cry of surprise and said, &ldquo;Then you know all about it, and the
      sermon <i>was</i> meant for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak for a moment, and then he said with a thick utterance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish me to help you to break off this marriage, and I will try. But
      if I fail&mdash;no matter what has happened in the past, or what awaits
      you in the future&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I had your strength beside me I should be brave&mdash;I
      should be afraid of nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear lady,&rdquo; said John Storm; and before he could prevent her
      she had stooped over his hand and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had returned to his book and was clutching it with nervous
      fingers, when his fellow-curate came with a message from the canon to
      request his presence in the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I was on the point of going down,&rdquo; said John. And the Reverend
      Golightly coughed and bowed himself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canon had also had a visitor that morning. It was Mrs. Macrae herself.
      She sat on a chair covered with a tiger skin, sniffed at her scented
      handkerchief, and poured out all her sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercy had rebelled against her authority, and it was entirely the fault of
      the new curate, Mr. Storm. She had actually refused to carry out her
      engagement with Lord Robert, and it all came of that dreadful sermon on
      Sunday. It was dishonourable, it was unprincipled, and it was a pretty
      thing to teach girls to indulge their whims without regard to the wishes
      of parents!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here have I been two years in London, spending a fortune on the girl and
      trying to do my best for her, and the moment I fix her in one of the first
      English families, this young man&mdash;this curate&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;
      Upon my honour, it&rsquo;s real wicked, it&rsquo;s shameful!&rdquo; And the handkerchief
      steeped in perfume went up from the nose to the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canon swung his <i>pince-nez</i>. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put yourself about, my dear
      Mrs. Macrae. Leave the matter to me. Miss Macrae will give up her
      objections, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t judge her by her quietness, canon. You don&rsquo;t know her
      character. She&rsquo;s real stubborn when her mind&rsquo;s made up. But I&rsquo;ll be as
      stubborn as she is&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take her back to America&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never
      spend another penny&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as for Mr. Storm,&rdquo; continued the canon, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make everything smooth
      in that quarter. You mustn&rsquo;t think too much about the unhappy sermon&mdash;a
      little youthful <i>esprit fort</i>&mdash;we all go through it, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Macrae had gone, he rang twice for Mr. Golightly and said, &ldquo;Tell
      Mr. Storm to come down to me immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, sir,&rdquo; said the little man; and then he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said the canon, adjusting his glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never told you, sir, how I found him the night you sent me to the
      hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his knees to a Catholic priest who was visiting a patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The canon&rsquo;s glasses fell from his eyes and his broad face broke into
      strange smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the Sorceress of Rome was at the bottom of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His
      uncle shall know of this, and unless I am sadly deceived&mdash;but fetch
      him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was wearing his flannel shirt that morning, and he came
      downstairs with a heavy tread and swung himself, unasked, into the chair
      that had just before been occupied by Mrs. Macrae.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perpendicular wrinkles came between the canon&rsquo;s eyebrows and he said:
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Storm, I have postponed as long as possible a most painful
      interview. The fact is, your recent sermon has given the greatest offence
      to the ladies of my congregation, and if such teaching were persisted in
      we should lose our best people. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to be angry with you,
      quite the contrary, but I wish to put it to you, as your spiritual head
      and adviser, that your idea of religion is by no means agreeable to the
      needs and necessities of the nineteenth century. There is no freedom in
      such a faith, and St. Paul says, &lsquo;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there
      is liberty.&rsquo; But the theory of your religion is not more unscriptural than
      its application is unwholesome. Yours is a gloomy faith, my dear Storm,
      and what did Luther say of a gloomy faith?&mdash;that the devil was very
      apt to be lurking behind it. As for himself he married, you may remember;
      he had children, he played chess, he loved to see young people dancing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t object to the dancing, sir,&rdquo; said John Storm. &ldquo;I only object to
      the tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said the canon, not without insolence, and the
      perpendicular wrinkles became large and heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, sir,&rdquo; said John Storm, &ldquo;that half the young people nowadays&mdash;the
      young women in the west of London especially&mdash;are asked to dance to
      the Dead March.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he spoke of the infamous case of Mercy Macrae, how she was being
      bought and sold, and how scandalous was the reputation of the man she was
      required to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what I was coming down to speak about, sir&mdash;to ask you to
      save this innocent girl from such a mockery of holy wedlock. She is not a
      child, and the law can not help her, but you can do so, because the power
      of the Church is at your back. You have only to set your face against this
      infamy, and say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Storm,&rdquo; the canon was smiling condescendingly and swinging
      his glasses, &ldquo;the business of the Church is to solemnize marriages, not to
      make them. But if the young lady comes to me I will say: &lsquo;My dear young
      lady, the conditions you complain of are more common than you suppose; put
      aside all foolish, romantic notions, make a nest for yourself as
      comfortably as you can, and come back in a year to thank me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was on his feet; the blood was mounting to his face and
      tingling in his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so these men are to make their wives of the daughters of the poor
      first, and then ask the Church to solemnize their polygamy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the canon had lifted his hand to silence him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young friend, a policy like yours would decimate the House of
      Commons and abolish the House of Lords. Practical religion has a sweet
      reasonableness. We are all human, even if we are all gentlemen; and while
      silly young things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John Storm was out in the hall and putting on his hat to see Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory had not yet awakened from her trance. While others were living in
      to-day she was still going about in yesterday. The emotion of the theatre
      was upon her, and the world of reality took the tone and colour of drama.
      This made her a tender woman, but a bad nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began the day in the Outpatient Department, and a poor woman came with
      a child that had bitten its tongue. Its condition required that it should
      remain in the house a day or two. &ldquo;Let me put the pore thing to bed; she&rsquo;s
      allus used to me,&rdquo; said the woman piteously. &ldquo;Are you the mother?&rdquo; said
      the Sister. &ldquo;No, the grandmother.&rdquo; &ldquo;The mother is the only person who can
      enter the wards except on visiting day.&rdquo; The poor woman began to cry.
      Glory had to carry the child to bed, and she whispered to the grandmother,
      &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; and the woman followed her. When they came to the
      surgical ward, she said to the nurse in charge, &ldquo;This is the child&rsquo;s
      mother, and she has come to put the poor little thing to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later in the morning she was sent up to help in the same ward. A patient
      in great pain called to her and said, &ldquo;Loosen this bandage for me, nurse;
      it is killing me!&rdquo; And she loosened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the glamour of the theatre was upon her as well as its sentiment and
      emotion, and in the space before the bed of one of the patients, at a
      moment when the ward Sister was away, she began to make imitations of
      Beatrice and Benedick and the singer of &ldquo;Sigh no more, ladies.&rdquo; The
      patient was Koenig, the choirmaster of &ldquo;All Saints&rsquo;,&rdquo; a little fat German
      with long mustaches, which he waxed and curled as he lay in bed. Glory had
      christened him &ldquo;the hippopotamus,&rdquo; and at her mimicry he laughed so much
      that he rolled and pitched and dived among the bedclothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach, Gott!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;vot a girl! Never&mdash;I haf never heard any one
      so goot on de stage. Vot a voice, too! A leetle vork under a goot teacher,
      and den, mein Gott! Vot is it de musicians say?&mdash;the genius has a
      Cremona inside of him on which he first composes his immortal vorks. You
      haf the Cremona, my dear, and I will help you to bring it out. Vot you
      tink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the hour of the morning when the patients who can afford it have
      their newspapers brought up to them, but the newspapers were thrown aside;
      every eye was on Glory, and there was much noisy laughter and even some
      clapping of hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ward Sister Allworthy entered with the house doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo; she demanded. Glory told the truth, and was
      reproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has loosened this bandage?&rdquo; said the doctor. The patient tried to
      prevaricate, but Glory told the truth again, and was reproved once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who permitted this woman to come into the ward?&rdquo; said the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not fit to be a nurse, miss, and I shall certainly report you as
      unfit for duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory laughed in the Sister&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that John Storm arrived after his interview with the
      canon. He drew Glory into the corridor and tried to pacify her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;m going to do hospital nursing all my life,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;It may be good womanly work, but I want to be a human being with a
      heart, and not a machine called Duty. How I hate and despise my
      surroundings! I&rsquo;ll make an end of them one of these days. Sooner or later
      it must come to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your life has been deranged, Glory, and that is why you disdain your
      surroundings. You were at the theatre last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that? Well, what of it? Are you one of those who think the
      theatre&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t object to the theatre, Glory. It is the derangement of your life
      I am thinking of; and if anybody is responsible for that he is your enemy,
      not your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will make me angry again, as you did before,&rdquo; and she began to bite
      her quivering lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come to make you angry, Glory. I came to ask you&mdash;even to
      entreat you&mdash;to break off this hateful connection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you know nothing of this&mdash;this connection, as you say&mdash;you
      call it hateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I am talking about, my child. The life these men live is
      worse than hateful; and it makes my heart bleed to see you falling a
      victim to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are degrading me again; you are always degrading me. Other men try to
      be agreeable to me, but you&mdash;&mdash; Besides, I can not hear my
      friends abused. Yes, they <i>are</i> my friends. I <i>was</i> at the
      theatre with them last night, and I am going to take tea at their chambers
      on my next holiday. So please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one plunge of his arm he had gripped her by the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hurting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are never to set foot in the rooms of those men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as inexperienced as a child, Glory, and it is my duty to protect
      you against yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t destroy yourself. Think while there&rsquo;s time&mdash;think of your good
      name, your character!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do as I please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! If I have chosen to be a clergyman, it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;ve lived
      all my life in cotton wool. Let me tell you what the lives of such men
      really are&mdash;the best of them, the very best. He gets up at noon,
      walks in the park, takes tea with some one, grunts and groans that he must
      go to somebody&rsquo;s dinner party, escapes to the Gaiety Theatre, sups at a
      so-called club&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Lord Robert. But what right have you to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The right of one who knows him to be as bad as this, and worse&mdash;ten
      times worse! Such a man thinks he has a right to play with a girl if she
      is poor. She may stake her soul, her salvation, but he risks nothing.
      To-day he trifles with her; to-morrow he marries another, and flings her
      to the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else in this. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John Storm had swung about and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was at liberty she went in search of Polly Love, expecting
      to find her in her cubicle, but the cubicle was empty. Coming out of the
      little room she saw a piece of paper lying on the floor. It was a letter,
      carefully folded. She picked it up, unfolded it, and read it, hardly
      knowing what she was doing, for her head was dizzy and her eyes were
      swimming in unshed tears. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask, Do I mean to adopt entirely? Yes; to bring up just the same as
      if it were born to me. I hope yours will be a strong and healthy boy; but
      if it is a girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory could not understand what she was reading. Whose letter could it be?
      It was addressed &ldquo;X. Y. Z., Office of <i>Morning Post</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hurried footstep approaching, and Polly came in, with her eyes
      on the ground as if looking for something she had dropped. At the next
      moment she had snatched the letter out of Glory&rsquo;s hand, and was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing in my room? Has your friend the chaplain told you to
      spy upon me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression on her face was appalling, and Glory, who had flushed up
      with shame, turned away without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Storm got back to his room he found the following letter from
      the canon on his table:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since our interview of this morning (so strangely abridged) I have had
      the honour to visit your dear uncle, the Prime Minister, and he agrees
      with me that the strain of your recent examinations and the anxieties of a
      new occupation have probably disturbed your health, and that it will be
      prudent of you to take a short vacation. I have therefore the greatest
      pleasure in assuring you that you are free from duty for a week, a
      fortnight, or a month, as your convenience may determine; and during your
      much-regretted absence I will do my best to sustain the great loss of your
      invaluable help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On reading the message, John Storm flung himself into a chair and burst
      into a long peal of bitter laughter. But when the laughter was spent there
      came a sense of great loneliness. Then he remembered Mrs. Callender, and
      went across to her little house in Victoria Square, and showed her the
      canon&rsquo;s letter and told her everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lies, lies, lies!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ah, laddie, laddie! to lie, to know you
      lie, to be known to lie, and yet to go on lying&mdash;that is the whole
      art of life with these fashionable shepherds and their fashionable flock.
      As for that woman&mdash;ugh! She was separated from her husband for two
      years before his death; and he died in a hotel abroad without kith or kin
      to comfort him: and now she wears his hair in a gold locket on her bosom&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what she is! But all&rsquo;s well that ends well, laddie. The <i>holly</i> will
      do ye good, for you were killing yerself with work. You&rsquo;ll no be spending
      it in your little island, now, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was sitting with one leg across the other, and his head on his
      hand and his elbow on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall spend it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in Retreat at the Brotherhood in
      Bishopsgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless me, man! is that the change of air ye&rsquo;ll be going to gie
      yoursel&rsquo;? It may be well enough for men with water in their veins; but you
      have blood, laddie&mdash;blood! Tak&rsquo; care, tak&rsquo; care!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still at Martha&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, dear Aunt Anna, the terms &lsquo;authority&rsquo; and &lsquo;obedience&rsquo; must
      be known and honoured. Only, when it is a case of put a penny in the slot
      and out comes the word of command, you can&rsquo;t exactly feel that way. The
      board of directors put the penny into the slot of this institution, and
      the word of command, so far as I am concerned, comes out of the mouth of
      Ward Sister Allworthy. I call her the White Owl. She is five feet ten, and
      has big round cheeks which sometimes I should dearly love to slap&mdash;as
      mothers slap their &lsquo;childers&rsquo; when they administer a humiliating
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think you notice &lsquo;a certain want of aptitude&rsquo;? Well, I don&rsquo;t think
      I am naturally a bad nurse, Aunt Anna. The patients like me, and they
      don&rsquo;t die of the dumps when I am about. Only I can&rsquo;t practise nursing by
      the rule of three, and as a consequence I get myself reported. Sister
      Allworthy has reported me three times, bless her! Thrice the brinded cat
      hath mewed, and now she threatens to have me up before the matron. That
      dear soul has difficulties of locomotion, being buried under the Pelion on
      Ossa of a mountain of fat. She inhabits a cave of Adullam on the edge of
      the Inferno&mdash;i. e., the &lsquo;theatre&rsquo;&mdash;below stairs, and has a small
      dog with a bad heart and broken wind always nagging on her knee. I call
      her the Chief Broker in Breakages and Head Dealer in Diseases, and she is
      only seen once a day when she comes round to take stock. You have to be
      nice with her Majesty,&rsquo; for she can haul you up at the weekly board, and
      put a score against you in the black book, and send you away without a
      certificate. If that happens, a girl who expects to earn her living as a
      nurse has never any particular need to pray, &lsquo;In all time of our wealth,
      good Lord deliver us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, oh, my dear grandfather, what do you think of our John Storm now?
      After uttering the lamentations of Jeremiah and predicting all the plagues
      of Egypt, he has gone off to hold his peace&mdash;that is to say, he has
      gone to make his &lsquo;Retreat,&rsquo; which, being interpreted, means praying
      without ceasing, and also without speaking, eighteen hours a day, six days
      at a spell, and sometimes sixty. When he comes back reeking with all that
      holiness I shall feel myself such a miserable sinner&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soberly, I could cry to think of it, though, and when I remember that
      perhaps I was partly to blame&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was this way: In that &lsquo;ter&rsquo;ble discoorse&rsquo; I told you he had scotched
      the snake, not killed it, and his vicar (I call him Mr. Worldly Wiseman),
      finding that his ladies and nobility went out like the Pharisees, one by
      one, told our poor John he was ill and stood in need of instant rest. It
      looked like it certainly, and the trouble must have been a sort of human
      rabies in which the poor victim bites at his best friends first. He came
      here with his lower lip hanging like an old dog&rsquo;s, and I was so stupid as
      not to see that he was being hunted like a dog too, and only told myself
      how ugly and untidy he had grown of late. But the Sister had just before
      been showing me her tusks again, and being possessed with a fury, I gave
      it him world without end. He was very unreasonable though, and seemed to
      say that I must have no friends and no amusements that were not of his
      choosing, and that after spending my days walking through the inside of
      this precious hospital I must spend my nights walking round the outside of
      it. Being a woman of like passions with himself, I had a &lsquo;ter&rsquo;ble dust&rsquo; 
      with him on the subject, and the next I heard was that he was going to
      make Retreat in a kind of English-church monastery somewhere in the city,
      where he would &lsquo;try to disentangle&rsquo; himself &lsquo;from the world&rsquo; and see what
      he &lsquo;ought to do next.&rsquo; He sent me his blessing with this message, and I
      sent him back mine&mdash;a less holy one, but he&rsquo;ll make it do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would remember Mr. Drake&rsquo;s mother, dear Auntie Rachel. Yes,
      he is fair also, and wears his hair brushed across his forehead, much as
      you see in the portraits of Napoleon. In fact, he is a sort of fair-haired
      Napoleon in nature as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took me to the theatre the other evening, and that was the great event
      I intended to tell you about. It was quite a proper sort of place, and
      nobody behaved badly except Glory, who kept talking and preaching and
      going silly with excitement all the evening through, with the result that
      everybody was staring mewards and wanting to turn me out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since then Mr. Drake&rsquo;s friend, Lord Bob, who knows all the actors on
      earth seemingly, has taken us &lsquo;behind,&rsquo; and we have seen a rehearsal.
      Things don&rsquo;t look quite the same behind as before, but nothing in the
      world does that, and I wasn&rsquo;t a bit disenchanted. In fact, I found
      everything delightfully romantic and amusing, and really I do not think it
      <i>can</i> be so very wicked to be an actress. Do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Polly Love was with us. Polly is a probationer also, and sleeps
      in the cubicle next to mine, and after the rehearsal we went to the
      gentlemen&rsquo;s chambers to tea. I can hear what Aunt Anna is saying:
      &lsquo;Goodness gracious! you didn&rsquo;t do that, girl?&rsquo; Well, yes, I did though. In
      the interest of my sex I wanted to see how two boys could live in rooms
      all by themselves, and it&rsquo;s perfectly shocking how well they get on
      without a woman. Of course I wasn&rsquo;t such a silly as to let wit about that,
      but after I had examined their sitting-room and cross-examined its owners
      on its numerous photographs (chiefly feminine) and tried how it feels to
      hold their big pipes between one&rsquo;s teeth, I whipped off my hat at once and
      began to put things straight for them, and then I made the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time the gentlemen had changed into their jackets, and I sent
      them flying around for cups and saucers and sugar basins. It turned out
      that they had only one teaspoon in the place, and when anybody wanted to
      stir her tea she said, &lsquo;Will you oblige me with <i>spoon</i> please?&rsquo; What
      fun it was! We laughed until we cried&mdash;at least one of us did&mdash;and
      eventually we managed to break the teapot and a slop basin and to overturn
      a standing lamp. It was perfectly delightful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the best sport was after tea was over, and Glory was called on for
      imitations of the people we had seen at the theatre. Of course she
      couldn&rsquo;t imitate a man when she was in a woman&rsquo;s frock, so being as bright
      as diamonds that night and twice &lsquo;as impudent as a white stone,&rsquo; [* A Manx
      proverb] she actually conceived the idea of dressing up in man&rsquo;s clothes.
      Naturally the gentlemen were enchanted, so I hope Auntie Rachel isn&rsquo;t
      terribly shocked. Mr. Drake lent me his knickerbockers and a velvet
      jacket, and Polly and I went into the bedroom, where she helped me to find
      the way to put them on. With my own blouse and my own hat (I am wearing a
      felt one now with a broad brim and a feather), and <i>of course</i> my own
      slippers and stockings, I made a bogh of a boy, I can tell you. I thought
      Polly would have died of delight in the bedroom, but when we came out she
      kept covering her face and crying, &lsquo;Glory, how <i>can</i> you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I sang and talked more than was good for the soul, but it was
      all Mr. Drake&rsquo;s doing. He declared I was such a marvellous mimic that it
      was simply a waste of time and the good gifts of God to go on hospital
      nursing any longer. And I do believe that if anything happened, and the
      need arose, he would&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only fancy Glory a public person, and all the world and his wife going
      down on their knees to her! But then it&rsquo;s fearful to think of being an
      actress, isn&rsquo;t it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all such glorious &lsquo;outs&rsquo; I have to go &lsquo;in&rsquo; to the hospital, and
      then comes my fit again. Do you remember my little boy who said he was
      going to the angels, and he would get lots of gristly pork up there? He
      has gone, and I don&rsquo;t think I like nursing children now. Oh, how I long to
      go out into the world! I want to shine in it. I want to become great and
      glorious. I could do it too, I know I could. I have got it in me, I am
      sure I have. Yet here I am in a little dark corner crying for the
      sunshine!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How silly this is, isn&rsquo;t it? It sounds like madness. My dears, allow me
      to introduce you to some one&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>

      The board room of the hospital of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard was a large and
      luxurious chamber, with an oval window at its farther end, and its two
      side walls panelled with portraits of former chairmen and physicians. In
      great oaken armchairs, behind ponderous oaken tables, covered with green
      cloth and furnished with writing pads, the Board of Governors sat in three
      sides of a square, leaving an open space in the middle. This open space
      was reserved for patients seeking admission or receiving discharge, and
      for officers of the hospital presenting their weekly reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a morning in August the matron&rsquo;s report had closed with a startling
      item. It recommended the immediate suspension of a nurse on the ground of
      gross impropriety of conduct. The usual course in such a case was for the
      board of the hospital to depute the matron to act for them in private, but
      the chairman in this instance was a peppery person, with a stern mouth and
      a solid under-jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a most serious matter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think&mdash;this being a
      public institution&mdash;I really think the board should investigate the
      case for itself. We ought to assure ourselves that&mdash;that, in fact, no
      other irregularity is going on in the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it please your lordship,&rdquo; said a rotund voice from, one of the side
      tables, &ldquo;I would suggest that a case like this of grievous moral
      delinquency comes directly within the dispensation of the chaplain, and if
      he has done his duty by the unhappy girl (as no doubt he has) he must have
      a statement to make to the board with regard to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Canon Wealthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may mention,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that Mr. Storm has now returned to his duties,
      and is at present in the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for him,&rdquo; said the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Storm entered the board room it was remarked that he looked no
      better for his holiday. His cheeks were thinner, his eyes more hollow, and
      there was a strange pallor under his swarthy skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business was explained to him, and he was asked if he had any
      statement to make with regard to the nurse whom the matron had reported
      for suspension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have no statement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell the board,&rdquo; said the chairman, &ldquo;that you know nothing
      of this matter&mdash;that the case is too trivial for your attention&mdash;or
      perhaps that you have never even spoken to the girl on the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so&mdash;I never have,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you shall do so now,&rdquo; said the chairman, and he put his hand on the
      bell beside him, and the messenger appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can not intend, sir, to examine the girl here,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before so many&mdash;and all of us men save one. Surely the matron&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The canon rose to his feet again. &ldquo;My young brother is naturally
      sensitive, my lord, but I assure him his delicate feelings are wasted on a
      girl like this. He forgets that the shame lies in the girl&rsquo;s sin, not in
      her just and necessary punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring her in,&rdquo; said the chairman. The matron whispered to the messenger,
      and he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; said John Storm; &ldquo;if it is your expectation that I
      should question the nurse on her sin, as the canon says, I can not do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that your idea of your duty as a chaplain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the matron&rsquo;s duty, not the chaplain&rsquo;s, to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matron! The matron! This is your parish, sir&mdash;your parish. A
      great public institution is in danger of a disgraceful scandal, and you
      who are responsible for its spiritual welfare&mdash;really, gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the canon rose with a conciliatory smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand my young friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and your lordship and
      the hoard will appreciate his feelings, however you may disapprove of his
      judgment. What generous heart can not sympathize with the sensitive spirit
      of the youthful clergyman who shrinks from the spectacle of guilt and
      shame in a young and perhaps beautiful woman? But if it will relieve your
      lordship from an embarrassing position, I am myself willing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the chairman; and then the girl was brought into the
      room in charge of Sister Allworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was holding her head down and trying to cover her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name, girl?&rdquo; said the canon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Elizabeth Love,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware, Mary Elizabeth Love, that our excellent and indulgent
      matron&rdquo; (here he bowed to a stout lady who sat in the open space) &ldquo;has
      been put to the painful duty of reporting you for suspension, which is
      equivalent to your immediate discharge. Now, I can not hold out a hope
      that the board will not ratify her recommendation, but it may perhaps
      qualify the terms of your &lsquo;character&rsquo; if you can show these gentlemen that
      the unhappy lapse from good conduct which brings you to this position of
      shame and disgrace is due in any measure to irregularities practised
      perhaps within this hospital, or to the temptations of any one connected
      with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, nurse; if you have anything to say, the gentlemen are willing to
      hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s crying deepened into sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Useless!&rdquo; said the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said the canon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some one suggested that perhaps the nurse had a girl friend in the
      hospital who could throw light on the difficult situation. Then Sister
      Allworthy whispered to the matron, who said, &ldquo;Bring her in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s face had assumed a fixed and absent expression, but he saw a
      girl of larger size than Polly Love enter the room with a gleam, as it
      were, of sunshine on her golden-red hair. It was Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some preliminary whispering, and then the canon began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a friend and companion of Mary Elizabeth Love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was full and calm, and a look of quiet courage lit up her
      girlish beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have known her other friends, no doubt, and perhaps you have shared
      her confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can tell the board if the unhappy condition in which she finds
      herself is due to any one connected with this hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to any officer, servant, or member of any school attached to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the chairman, &ldquo;that is quite enough,&rdquo; and down the
      tables of the governors there were nods and smiles of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done a great service to an ancient and honourable institution,&rdquo;
       said the canon, &ldquo;and the best return the board can make for your candour
      and intelligence is to advise you to avoid such companionship for the
      future and to flee such perilous associations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A certain desperate recklessness expressed itself in Glory&rsquo;s face, and she
      stepped up to Polly, who was now weeping audibly, and put her arm about
      the girl&rsquo;s waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the girl&rsquo;s relatives?&rdquo; said the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matron replied out of her book. Polly was an orphan, both her parents
      being dead. She had a brother who had lately been a patient in the
      hospital, but he was only a lay-helper in the Anglican Monastery at
      Bishopsgate Street, and therefore useless for present purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some further whispering about the tables. Was this the girl who
      had been recommended to the hospital by the coroner who had investigated a
      certain notorious and tragic case? Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have heard of some poor and low relations,&rdquo; said the canon,
      &ldquo;but their own condition is probably too needy to allow them to help her
      at a time like the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down to this moment Polly had done nothing but cry, but now she flamed up
      in a passion of pride and resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s false!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have no poor and low relations, and I want
      nobody&rsquo;s help. My friend is a gentleman&mdash;as much a gentleman as
      anybody here&mdash;and I can tell you his name, if you like. He lives in
      St. James&rsquo;s Street, and he is Lord&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, girl!&rdquo; said the canon, in a loud voice. &ldquo;We can not allow you to
      compromise the honour of a gentleman by mentioning his name in his
      absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John stepped to one of the tables of the governors and took up a pamphlet
      which lay there. It was the last annual report of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, with
      a list of its governors and subscribers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl is suspended,&rdquo; said the chairman, and reaching for the matron&rsquo;s
      book, he signed it and returned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the canon, &ldquo;appears to be a case for Mrs. Callender&rsquo;s
      Maternity Home at Soho, and with the consent of the board I will request
      the chaplain to communicate with that lady immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had heard, but he made no answer; he was turning over the
      leaves of the pamphlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canon hemmed and cleared his throat. &ldquo;Mary Elizabeth Love,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;you have brought a stain upon this honourable and hitherto irreproachable
      institution, but I trust and believe that ere long, and before your
      misbegotten child is born, you may see cause to be grateful for our
      forbearance and our charity. Speaking for myself, I confess it is an
      occasion of grief to me, and might well, I think, be a cause of sorrow to
      him who has had your spiritual welfare in his keeping&rdquo; (here he gave a
      look toward John), &ldquo;that you do not seem to realize the position of infamy
      in which you stand. We have always been taught to think of a woman as
      sweet and true and pure; a being hallowed to our sympathy by the most
      sacred associations, and endeared to our love by the tenderest ties, and
      it is only right&rdquo; (the canon&rsquo;s voice was breaking), &ldquo;it is only right, I
      say, that you should be told at once, and in this place&mdash;though
      tardily and too late&mdash;that for the woman who wrongs that ideal, as
      you have wronged it, there is but one name known among persons of good
      credit and good report&mdash;a hard name, a terrible name, a name of
      contempt and loathing&mdash;the name of <i>prostitute!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crushing the pamphlet in his hand, John Storm had taken a step toward the
      canon, but he was too late. Some one was there before him. It was Glory.
      With her head erect and her eyes flashing, she stood between the weeping
      girl and the black-coated judge, and everybody could see the swelling and
      heaving of her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You say you have been taught to think of a
      woman as sweet and pure. Well, <i>I</i> have been taught to think of a <i>man</i>
      as strong and brave, and tender and merciful to every living creature, but
      most of all to a woman, if she is erring and fallen. But you are not brave
      and tender; you are cruel and cowardly, and I despise you and hate you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men at the tables were rising from their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you have discharged my friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you may discharge me,
      too, if you like&mdash;if you <i>dare</i>! But I will tell everybody that
      it was because I would not let you insult a poor girl with a cruel and
      shameful name, and trample upon her when she was down. And everybody will
      believe me, because it is the truth; and anything else you may say will be
      a lie, and all the world will know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matron was shambling up also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you, miss! Go back to your ward this instant! Do you know whom
      you are speaking to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve spoken to a clergyman, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;m the
      daughter of a clergyman, and the granddaughter of a clergyman, and I know
      what a clergyman is when he is brave and good, and gentle and merciful to
      all women, and when he is a man and a gentleman&mdash;not a Pharisee and a
      crocodile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take that girl away,&rdquo; said the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But John Storm was by her side in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nobody shall do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But now Glory had broken down too, and the girls, like two lost children,
      were crying on each other&rsquo;s breasts. John opened the door and led them up
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your friend to her room, nurse: I shall be with you presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned back to the chairman, still holding the crumpled pamphlet
      in his hand, and said calmly and respectfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that you have finished with the woman, sir, may I ask what you
      intend to do with the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I did not feel myself qualified to sit in judgment on the broken
      heart of a fallen girl, I happen to know the name which she was forbidden
      to mention, and I find it here, sir&mdash;here in your list of subscribers
      and governors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have wiped the girl out of your books, sir. Now I ask you to wipe the
      man out also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the chairman, rising, &ldquo;the business of the board is at
      an end.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Storm wrote a letter to Mrs. Callender explaining Polly Love&rsquo;s
      situation and asking her to call on the girl immediately, and then he went
      out in search of Lord Robert Ure at the address he had discovered in the
      report.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the man alone on his arrival, but Drake came in soon afterward.
      Lord Robert received him with a chilly bow; Drake offered his hand coldly;
      neither of them requested him to sit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are surprised at my visit, gentlemen,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;but I have just
      now been present at a painful scene, and I thought it necessary that you
      should know something about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he described what had occurred in the board room, and in doing so
      dwelt chiefly on the abjectness of the girl&rsquo;s humiliation. Lord Robert
      stood by the window rapping a tune on the window pane, and Drake sat in a
      low chair with his legs stretched out and his hands in his trousers
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am at a loss to understand why you have thought it necessary to
      come here to tell that story,&rdquo; said Lord Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Robert,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;you understand me perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Storm, I do not understand you in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will not ask you if you are responsible for the girl&rsquo;s position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will ask you a simpler and easier question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going to marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert burst into ironical laughter and faced round to Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, these men&mdash;these curates&mdash;their assurance, don&rsquo;t you
      know... May I ask your reverence what is <i>your</i> position in this
      matter&mdash;your standing, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of chaplain of the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you say she has been, turned out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Lord Robert, merely that of a man who intends to protect an
      injured woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; said Lord Robert dryly, &ldquo;I understand these heroics. I&rsquo;ve
      heard of your sermons, Mr. Storm&mdash;your interviews with ladies, and so
      forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have heard of your doings with girls,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;What are you
      going to do for this one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what I please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care! You know what the girl is. It&rsquo;s precisely such girls&mdash;&mdash;
      At this moment she is tottering on the brink of hell, Lord Robert. If
      anything further should happen&mdash;if you should disappoint her&mdash;she
      is looking to you and building up hopes&mdash;if she should fall still
      lower and destroy herself body and soul&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Storm, please understand that I shall do everything or
      nothing for the girl exactly as I think well, don&rsquo;t you know, without the
      counsel or coercion of any clergyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence, and then John Storm said quietly: &ldquo;It is no
      worse than I expected. But I had to hear it from your own lips, and I have
      heard it. Good-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back to the hospital and asked for Glory. She was banished with
      Polly to the housekeeper&rsquo;s room. Polly was catching flies on the window
      (which overlooked the park) and humming, &ldquo;Sigh no more, ladies.&rdquo; Glory&rsquo;s
      eyes were red with weeping. John drew Glory aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written to Mrs. Callender, and she will be here presently,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; said Glory. &ldquo;Polly will refuse to go. She expects Lord
      Robert to come for her, and she wants me to call on Mr. Drake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have seen the man myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Robert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He will do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, or worse than nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of that kind is impossible to men like those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not so bad as that though, and even if Lord Robert is all you
      say, Mr. Drake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are friends and housemates, Glory, and what the one is the other
      must be also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Mr. Drake is quite a different person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be misled, my child. If there were any real difference between them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is; and if a girl were in trouble or wanted help in anything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would drop her, Glory, like an old lottery ticket that has drawn a
      blank and is done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was biting her lip, and it was bleeding slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dislike Mr. Drake,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that is why you can not be just to
      him. But he is always praising and excusing you, and when any one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His praises and excuses are nothing to me. I am not thinking of myself. I
      am thinking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a look of intense excitement, and his speaking was abrupt and
      disconnected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were splendid this morning, Glory, and when I think of the girl who
      defied that Pharisee, being perhaps herself the victim&mdash;The man asked
      me what my standing was, as if that&mdash;But if I had really had a right,
      if the girl had been anything to me, if she had been somebody else and not
      a light, shallow, worthless creature, do you know what I should have said
      to him? &lsquo;Since things have gone so far, sir, you must marry the girl now,
      and keep to her and be faithful to her, and love her, or else I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are flushed and excited, and there is something I do not understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me, Glory, that you will break off this bad connection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unreasonable. I can not promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise that you will never see these men again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must see Mr. Drake at once and arrange about Polly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention the man&rsquo;s name again; it makes my blood boil to hear you
      speak it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is tyranny; and you are worse than the canon; and I can not bear
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; as you will. It&rsquo;s of no use struggling&mdash;What is the
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock nearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see the canon before he goes to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner had changed suddenly. He looked crushed and benumbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going now.&rdquo; he said, turning aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon? When shall I see you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows!&mdash;I mean&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered in a helpless
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking around, as if taking a mental farewell of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can not part like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think you like me a little
      still, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her supplicating voice made him look up into her face for a moment. Then
      he turned away, saying, &ldquo;Good-bye, Glory.&rdquo; And with a look of utter
      exhaustion he went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory walked to a window at the end of the corridor that she might see him
      when he crossed the street. There was just a glimpse of his back as he
      turned the corner with a slow step and his head on his breast. She went
      back crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could fancy a fresh herring for supper, dear,&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;What do you
      say, housekeeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm went back to the canon&rsquo;s house a crushed and humiliated man. &ldquo;I
      can do no more,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I will give it up.&rdquo; His old influence with
      Glory must have been lost. Something had come between them&mdash;something
      or some one. &ldquo;Anyhow it is all over and I must go away somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To go on seeing Glory would be useless. It would also be dangerous. As
      often as he was face to face with her he wanted to lay hold of her and
      say, &ldquo;You must do this and this, because it is my wish and direction and
      command, and it is <i>I</i> that say so!&rdquo; In the midst of God&rsquo;s work how
      subtle were the temptations of the devil!
    </p>
    <p>
      But with every step that he went plodding home there came other feelings.
      He could see the girl quite plainly, her fresh young face, so strong and
      so tender, so full of humour and heart&rsquo;s love, and all the sweet beauty of
      her form and figure. Then the old pain in his breast came back again and
      he began to be afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take refuge in the Church,&rdquo; he thought. In prayer and penance and
      fasting he would find help and consolation. The Church was peace&mdash;peace
      from the noise of life, and strength to fight and to vanquish. But the
      Church must be the Church of God&mdash;not of the world, the flesh, and
      the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the canon if he can see me immediately,&rdquo; said John Storm to the
      footman, and he stood in the hall for the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canon had taken tea that day in the study with his daughter Felicity.
      He was reclining on the sofa, propped up with velvet cushions, and holding
      the teacup and saucer like the wings of a butterfly in both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been deceived, my dear&rdquo; (sip, sip), &ldquo;and we must pay the penalty
      of the deception. Yet we have nothing to blame ourselves for&mdash;nothing
      whatever. Here was a young man, from Heaven knows where, bent on entering
      the diocese. True, he was merely the son of a poor lord who had lived the
      life of a hermit, but he was also the nephew, and presumably the heir, of
      the Prime Minister of England&rdquo; (sip, sip, sip). &ldquo;Well, I gave him his
      title. I received him into my house. I made him free of my family&mdash;and
      what is the result? He has disregarded my instructions, antagonized my
      supporters, and borne himself toward me with an attitude of defiance, if
      not disdain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felicity poured out a second cup of tea for her father, sympathized with
      him, and set forth her own grievances. The young man had no conversation,
      and his reticence was quite embarrassing. Sometimes when she had friends,
      and asked him to come down, his silence&mdash;well, really&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might have borne with these little deficiencies, my dear, if the Prime
      Minister had been deeply interested. But he is not. I doubt if he has ever
      seen his nephew since that first occasion. And when I called at Downing
      Street, about the time of the sermon, he seemed entirely undisturbed. &lsquo;The
      young man is in the wrong place, my dear canon; send him back to me.&rsquo; That
      was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo; said Felicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is coming to that, my child; but blood is thicker than water, you
      know, and after all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment the footman entered the room to ask if the canon
      could see Mr. Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the man himself!&rdquo; said the canon, rising. &ldquo;Jenkyns, remove the tray.&rdquo;
       Dropping his voice: &ldquo;Felicity, I will ask you to leave us together. After
      what occurred this morning at the hospital anything like a scene&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Then aloud: &ldquo;Bring him in, Jenkyns.&mdash;Say something, my dear. Why
      don&rsquo;t you speak?&mdash;Come in, my dear Storm.&mdash;You&rsquo;ll see to that
      matter for me, Felicity. Thanks, thanks! Sorry to send you off, but I&rsquo;m
      sure Mr. Storm will excuse you. Good-bye for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felicity went out as John Storm came in. He looked excited, and there was
      an expression of pain in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to disturb you, but I need not detain you long,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Storm, sit down,&rdquo; said the canon, returning to the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      But John did not sit. He stood by the chair vacated by Felicity, and kept
      beating his hat on the back of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to tell you, sir, that I wish to resign my curacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The canon glanced up with a stealthy expression, and thought: &ldquo;How clever
      of him! To resign before he is told plainly that he has to go&mdash;that
      is very clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he said aloud: &ldquo;I am sorry, very sorry. I&rsquo;m always sorry to part with
      my clergy. Still&mdash;you see I am entirely frank with you&mdash;I have
      observed that you have not been comfortable of late, and I think you are
      acting for the best. When do you wish to leave me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as convenient&mdash;as early as I can be spared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The canon smiled condescendingly. &ldquo;That need not trouble you at all. With
      a staff like mine, you see&mdash;&mdash; Of course, you are aware that I
      am entitled to three months&rsquo; notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will waive it; I will not detain you. Have you seen your uncle on
      the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you do so please say that I always try to remove impediments from a
      young man&rsquo;s path if he is uncomfortable&mdash;in the wrong place, for
      example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said John Storm, and then he hesitated a moment before
      stepping to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canon rose and bowed affably. &ldquo;Not an angry word,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Who
      shall say that blood does not count for something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, my dear Storm,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;I shall always remember with
      pride and pleasure our early connection. Perhaps I think you are acting
      unwisely, even foolishly, but it will continue to be a source of
      satisfaction to me that I was able to give you your first opportunity, and
      if your next curacy should chance to be in London, I trust you will allow
      us to maintain the acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s face was twitching and his pulses were beating violently, but
      he was trying to control himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it is not very likely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say you are giving up Orders, dear Mr. Storm, or perhaps that you
      are only leaving our church in order to unite yourself to another. Ah!
      have I touched on a tender point? You must not be surprised that rumours
      have been rife. We can not silence the tongues of busybodies and
      mischief-makers, you know. And I confess, speaking as your spiritual head
      and adviser, it would be a source of grief to me if a young clergyman, who
      has eaten the bread of the Establishment, and my own as well, were about
      to avow himself the subject and slave of an Italian bishop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm came back from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you are saying, sir, requires that I should be plain spoken. In
      giving up my curacy I am not leaving the Church of England; I am only
      leaving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad, so relieved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am leaving you because I can not live with you any longer, because the
      atmosphere you breathe is impossible to me, because your religion is not
      my religion, or your God my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprise me. What have I done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month ago I asked you to set your face as a clergyman against the
      shameful and immoral marriage of a man of scandalous reputation, but you
      refused; you excused the man and sided with him. This morning you thought
      it necessary to investigate in public the case of one of that man&rsquo;s
      victims, and you sided with the man again&mdash;you denied to the girl the
      right even to mention the scoundrel&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How differently we see things! Do you know I thought my examination of
      the poor young thing was merciful to the point of gentleness! And that, I
      may tell you&mdash;notwithstanding the female volcano who came down on me&mdash;was
      the view of the board and of his lordship the chairman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am sorry to differ from them. I thought it unnecessary and unmanly
      and brutal, and even blasphemous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Storm! Do you know what you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, and I came to say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were wild, his voice was hoarse; he was like a man breaking the
      bonds of a tyrannical slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You called that poor child a prostitute because she had wasted the good
      gifts which God had given her. But God has given good gifts to you also&mdash;gifts
      of intellect and eloquence with which you might have raised the fallen and
      supported the weak, and defended the downtrodden and comforted the
      broken-hearted&mdash;and what have you done with them? You have bartered
      them for benefices, and peddled them for popularity; you have given them
      in exchange for money, for houses, for furniture, for things like this&mdash;and
      this&mdash;and this! You have sold your birthright for a mess of pottage,
      therefore <i>you</i> are the prostitute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not yourself, sir; leave me,&rdquo; and, crossing the room, the canon
      touched the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ten thousand times more the prostitute than that poor fallen girl
      with her taint of blood and will! There would be no such women as she is
      to fall victims to evil companionship if there were no such men as you are
      to excuse their betrayers and to side with them. Who is most the
      prostitute&mdash;the woman who sells her body, or the man who sells his
      soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad, sir! But I want no scene&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the worst prostitute on the streets of London, and yet you are in
      the Church, in the pulpit, and you call yourself a follower of the One who
      forgave the woman and shamed the hypocrites, and had not where to lay his
      head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the canon had faced about and fled out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman came in answer to the bell, and, finding no one but John
      Storm, he told him that a lady was waiting for him in a carriage at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Callender. She had come to say that she had called at the
      hospital for Polly Love, and the girl had refused to go to the home at
      Soho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whatever&rsquo;s amiss with ye, man?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You might have seen a
      ghost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had come out bareheaded, carrying his hat in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited weeks and weeks for it, but it&rsquo;s
      over at last. It was of no use mincing matters, so I spoke out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His red eyes were ablaze, but a great load seemed to be lifted off his
      mind, and his soul seemed to exult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told him I must leave him, and I am to go, immediately. The
      disease was dire, and the remedy had to be dire also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was holding her breath and watching his flushed face with
      strained attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may ye be going to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To become a religious in something more than the name; to leave the world
      altogether with its idleness and pomp and hypocrisy and unreality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get yoursel&rsquo; some flesh on your bones first, man. It&rsquo;s easy to see ye&rsquo;ve
      no been sleeping or eating these days and days together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;nothing at all. God can not take half your soul. You
      must give yourself entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, laddie, laddie, I feared me this was what ye were coming til. But a
      man can not bury himself before he is dead. He may bury the half of
      himself, but is it the better half? What of his thoughts&mdash;his
      wandering thoughts? Choose for yoursel&rsquo;, though, and if you must go&mdash;if
      you must hide yoursel&rsquo; forever, and this is the last I&rsquo;m to see of ye&mdash;ye
      may kiss me, laddie&mdash;I&rsquo;m old enough, surely.&mdash;Go on, James, man,
      what for are ye sitting up there staring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When John Storm returned to his room he found a letter from Parson Quayle.
      It was a good-natured, cackling epistle, full of sweet nothings about
      Glory and the hospital, about Peel and the discovery of ancient ruins in
      the graveyards of the treen chapels, but it closed with this postscript:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remember old Chalse, a sort of itinerant beggar and the
      privileged pet of everybody. The silly old gawk has got hold of your
      father and has actually made the old man believe that you are bewitched!
      Some one has put the evil eye on you&mdash;some woman it would seem&mdash;and
      that is the reason why you have broken away and behaved so strangely! It
      is most extraordinary. That such a foolish superstition should have taken
      hold of a man like your father is really quite astonishing, but if it will
      only soften his rancour against you and help to restore peace we may
      perhaps forgive the distrust of Providence and the outrage on common
      sense. All&rsquo;s well that ends well, you know, and we shall all be happy.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Lost, stolen, or strayed&mdash;a man, a clergyman, answers to the name of

      written to twice without making so much as a yap or a yowl by way of
      reply. Last seen six days ago, when he was suffering from the sulks, after
      being in a de&rsquo;il of a temper, with a helpless and innocent maiden who
      &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo;,&rsquo; that can have given him offence. Any one giving

      &ldquo;But, soberly, my dear John Storm, what has become of you? Where are you,

      compelled Lord Robert to provide for Polly, who is now safely ensconced in
      her own country castle somewhere in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, furnished to hand
      with servants and vassals complete. Thus you will be charmed to observe in
      me the growth of the prophetic instinct, for you will remember my positive
      prediction that if a girl were in trouble, and the necessity arose, Mr.
      Drake would be the first to help her. Of course, he had a great deal to
      say that was as sweet as syrup on the loyalty of my own friendship also,
      and he expended much beautiful rhetoric on yourself as well. It seems that
      you are one of those who follow the impulse of the heart entirely, while
      the rest of us divide our allegiance with the head; and if you display
      sometimes the severity of a tyrant of our sex, that is only to be set down
      as another proof of your regard and of the elevation of the pedestal
      whereon you desire us to be placed. Thus he reconciles me to the harmony
      of the universe, and makes all things easy and agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This being the case, I have now to inform you that Polly&rsquo;s baby has come,
      having hastened his arrival (it is a man, bless it!) owing either to the
      tears or the terrors of the crocodile. And being on night duty now, and
      therefore at liberty from 6.30 to 8.30, I intend to pay him my first call
      of ceremony this evening, when anybody else would be welcome to accompany
      me who might be willing to come to his shrine of innocence and love in the
      spirit of the wise men of the East. But, lest anybody <i>should</i>
      inquire for me at the hospital at the first of the hours aforesaid, this
      is to give warning that the White Owl has expressly forbidden all
      intercourse between the members of her staff and the discharged and
      dishonoured mother. Set it down to my spirit of contradiction that I
      intend to disregard the mandate, though I am only too well aware that the
      poor discharged and dishonoured one has no other idea of friendship than
      that of a loyalty in which she shares but is not sharing. Of course, woman
      is born to such selfishness as the sparks fly upward; but if I should ever
      meet with a man who isn&rsquo;t I will just give myself up to him&mdash;body and
      soul and belongings&mdash;unless he has a wife or other encumbrance
      already and is booked for this world, and in that event I will enter into
      my own recognisances and be bound over to him for the next. Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At six-thirty that evening Glory stood waiting in the portico of the
      hospital, but John Storm did not come. At seven she was ringing at the
      bell of a little house in St. John&rsquo;s Wood that stood behind a high wall
      and had an iron grating in the garden door. The bell was answered by a
      good-natured, slack-looking servant, who was friendly, and even familiar
      in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the young lady from the hospital? The missis told me about you.
      I&rsquo;m Liza, and come upstairs&mdash;Yes, doing nicely, thank you, both of
      &lsquo;em is&mdash;and mind your head, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polly was in a little bandbox of a bedroom, looking more pink and white
      than ever against the linen of her frilled pillow slips. By the bedside a
      woman of uncertain age in deep mourning, with little twinkling eyes and
      fat cheeks, was rocking the baby on her knee and babbling over it in words
      of maudlin endearment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless it, &lsquo;ow it do notice! Boo-loo-loo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory leaned over the little one and pronounced it the prettiest baby she
      had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syme &lsquo;ere miss. There ain&rsquo;t sech another in all London! It&rsquo;s jest the
      sort of baby you can love. Pore little thing, it&rsquo;s quite took to me
      already, as if it wanted to enkirridge you, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mrs. Jupe,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s going to take baby to nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boo-loo-loo-boo! And a nice new cradle&rsquo;s awaiting of it afront of the
      fire in my little back parlour. Boo-loo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you&rsquo;re never going to part with your baby!&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you suppose, dear? Do you think I&rsquo;m going to be tied to a
      child all my days, and never be able to go anywhere or do anything or
      amuse myself at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest that. It&rsquo;ll be to our mootual benefit, as I said when I answered
      your advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory asked the woman if she was married and had any children of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, miss? I&rsquo;ve been married eleven years, and I&rsquo;ve allwiz prayed the dear
      Lord to gimme childring. Got any? On&rsquo;y one little girl; but I want to
      adopt another from the birth, so as to have something to love when my
      own&rsquo;s growed up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory supposed that Polly could see her baby at any time, but the woman
      answered doubtfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can she see baby? Well, I would rather not, certingly. If I tyke it I
      want to feel it is syme as my very own and do my dooty by it, pore thing!
      And if the mother were coming and going I should allwiz feel as she &lsquo;ad
      the first claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polly showed no interest in the conversation until Mrs. Jupe asked for the
      name of her &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; in lieu of eighty pounds that were to be paid down
      on delivery of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, myke up your mind, my dear, and let me tyke it away at onct. Give
      me &lsquo;is nyme, that&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some hesitation Glory gave Lord Robert&rsquo;s name and address, and the
      woman prepared the child for its departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tyke on so, my dear. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t sech a great crime, and many a laidy
      of serciety &lsquo;as done worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the street door Glory asked Mrs. Jupe for her own address, and the
      woman gave her a card, saying if she ever wanted to leave the hospital it
      would be easy to help such a fine-looking young woman as she was to make a
      bit of living for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly recovered speedily from the trouble of the child&rsquo;s departure, and
      presently assumed an easy and almost patronizing tone toward Glory,
      pretending to be amused and even a little indignant when asked how soon
      she expected to be fit for business again, and able to do without Lord
      Robert&rsquo;s assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was as much to blame as he was. I
      wanted to escape from the drudgery of the hospital, and I knew he would
      take me when the time came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory left early, vowing in her heart she would come no more. When she
      changed her omnibus at Piccadilly the Circus was very full of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letter for you, nurse,&rdquo; said the porter as she entered the hospital. It
      was from John Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Glory: I have at length decided to enter the Brotherhood at
      Bishopsgate Street, and I am to go into the monastery this evening. It is
      not as a visitor that I am going this time, but as a postulant or novice
      and in the hope of becoming worthy in due course to take the vows of
      lifelong consecration. Therefore I am writing to you probably for the last
      time, and parting from you perhaps forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since we came up to London together I have suffered many shocks and
      disappointments, and I seem to have been torn in ribbons. My cherished
      dreams have proved to be delusions; the palaces I had built up for myself
      have turned out to be pasteboard, gilt, and rubbish; I have been robbed of
      all my jewels, or they have shown themselves to be shingle stones. In this
      condition of shame and disillusionment I am now resolved to escape at the
      same time from the world and from myself, for I am tired of both alike,
      and already I feel as if a great weight had been lifted off me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wish to speak of you. You must have thought me cantankerous, and so
      I have been sometimes, but always by conviction and on principle. I could
      not countenance the fashionable morality that is corrupting the manhood of
      the laity, or endure the toleration that is making the clergy thoroughly
      wicked; I could not without a pang see you cater to the world&rsquo;s appetites
      or be drawn into its gaieties and frivolities; and it was agony to me to
      fear that a girl of your pure if passionate nature might perhaps fall a
      victim to a gamester in life&rsquo;s follies&mdash;an actor indulging a pastime&mdash;a
      mere cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what you tell me of your friend&rsquo;s altered circumstances does not
      relieve me of such anxieties. The man who has deceived a girl once is
      likely to deceive her again. Short of marriage itself, such connections
      should be cut off entirely, whatever the price. When they are maintained
      in relations of liberty the victim is sure to be further victimized, and
      her last state is always worse than the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, I do not wish to blame anybody, least of all you, who have done
      everything for the best, and especially now when I am parting from you
      forever. You have never realized how much you have been to me, and I doubt
      if I knew it myself until to-day. You know how I was brought up&mdash;with
      a solitary old man&mdash;God be with him!&mdash;who tried to be good to me
      for the sake of his ambitions, and to love me for the sake of his revenge.
      I never knew my mother, I never had a sister, and I can never have a wife.
      You were all three to me and yourself besides. There were no women in our
      household, and you stood for woman in my life. I have never told you this
      before, but now I tell it as a dying man whispers his secret with his
      parting breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written my letters of farewell&mdash;one to my father, asking his
      forgiveness if I have done him any wrong; one to my uncle, with my love
      and thanks; and one to your good old grandfather, giving up my solemn and
      sacred trust of you. My conduct will of course be condemned as weak and
      foolish from many points of view, but by my departure some difficulties
      will be removed, and for the rest I have come to see that everything is
      done by the spirit and nothing by the flesh, and that by prayer and
      fasting I can help and protect you more than by counsel and advice. Thus
      everything is for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rule under which the Brothers live in community forbids them to write
      and receive letters without special permission, or even to think too
      constantly of the world outside; and now that I am on the eve of that new
      life, memories of the old one keep crowding on me as on a drowning man.
      But they are all of one period&mdash;the days when we were at Peel in your
      sweet little island, before the vain and cruel world came in between us,
      when you were a simple, merry girl, and I was little more than a happy
      boy, and we went plunging and laughing through your bright blue sea
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But earth&rsquo;s joys grow very dim and its glories are fading. That also is
      for the best. I have my Koh-i-noor&mdash;my desire to depart and surrender
      my life to God. John Storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything wrong, nurse? Feeling ill, ain&rsquo;t ye? Only dizzy a bit?
      Unpleasant news from home, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, something else. Let me sit in your room, porter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read the letter again and again, until the words seemed blurred and
      the lines irregular as a spider&rsquo;s web. Then she thought: &ldquo;We can not part
      forever like this. I must see him again whatever happens. Perhaps he has
      not yet gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now half-past eight and time to go on duty, but she went upstairs
      to Sister Allworthy and asked for an hour&rsquo;s further leave. The request was
      promptly refused. She went downstairs to the matron and asked for half an
      hour, only that she might see a friend away on a long journey, and that
      was refused too. Then she tightened her quivering lips, returned to the
      porter&rsquo;s room, fixed her bonnet on before the scratched pier-glass, and
      boldly walked out of the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now quite dark and the fashionable dinner hour of Belgravia, and as
      she hurried through the streets many crested and coroneted carriages drew
      up at the great mansions and discharged their occupants in evening dress.
      The canon&rsquo;s house was brilliantly lighted, and when the door was opened in
      answer to her knock she could see the canon himself at the head of his own
      detachment of diners coming downstairs with a lady in white silk chatting
      affably on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Storm at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footman, in powdered wig and white cotton gloves, answered haltingly.
      &ldquo;If it is&mdash;er&mdash;anything about the hospital, miss, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Golightly
      will attend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is Mr. Storm himself I wish to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gorn!&rdquo; said the footman, and he shut the door in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had an impulse to hammer on the door with her hand, and command the
      flunky to go down on his knees and beg her pardon. But what was the good?
      She had no time to think of herself now.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a last resource she would go to Bishopsgate. How dense the traffic
      seemed to be at Victoria! She had never felt so helpless before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was better in the city, and as she walked eastward, in the direction
      indicated by a policeman, every step brought her into quieter streets. She
      was now in that part of London which is the world&rsquo;s busiest market-place
      by day, but is shut up and deserted at night. Her light footsteps echoed
      against the shutters of the shops. The moon had risen, and she could see
      far down the empty street.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found the place at last. It was one of London&rsquo;s weather-beaten old
      churches, shouldered by shops on either hand, and almost pushed back by
      the tide of traffic. There was an iron gate at the side, leading by an
      arched passage to a little courtyard, which was bounded by two high blank
      walls, by the back wall of the church, and by the front of a large house
      with a small doorway and many small windows. In the middle of the
      courtyard there was a tree with a wooden seat round its trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And being there, she felt afraid and almost wished she had not come. The
      church was dimly lighted, and she thought perhaps the cleaners were
      within. But presently there was a sound of singing, in men&rsquo;s voices only,
      and without any kind of musical accompaniment. Just then the clock in the
      steeple struck nine, and chimes began to play:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Days and moments quickly flying.
</pre>
    <p>
      The singing came to an end, and there was some low, inarticulate droning,
      and then a general &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; The hammer of the bell continued to beat out
      its hymn, and Glory stood under the shadow of the tree to collect her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sacristy door opened and a line of men came out. They were in
      long black cassocks, and they crossed the courtyard from the church to the
      house with the measured and hasty step of monks, and with their hands
      clasped at their breasts. Almost at the end of the line, walking with an
      old man whose tread was heavy, there was a younger one who was bareheaded,
      and who did not wear the cassock. The moon threw a light on his face,
      which looked pale and worn. It was John Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory gave a faint cry, a gasp, and he turned round as if startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the creaking of the sycamore,&rdquo; said the Superior. And then the
      mysterious shadows took them; they passed into the house, the door was
      closed, and she was alone with the chimes:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Days and moments quickly flying,
  Blend the living with the dead.
</pre>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s strength had deserted her, and she went away as she came. When she
      got back to Victoria, she felt for the first time as if her own little
      life had been swallowed up in the turmoil of London, and she had gone down
      to the cold depths of an icy sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a quarter to ten when she returned to the ward, and the matron,
      with her dog on her lap, was waiting to receive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that you could not go out to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how did you dare to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory looked at her unwaveringly, with glittering eyes that seemed to
      smile, whereupon the matron picked up her dog, gathered up her train, and
      swept out of the ward, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nurse, you can leave me at the end of your term; and you need never cross
      the doors of this institution again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Glory, who had all night wanted to cry, burst into laughter. The ward
      Sister reproved her, but she laughed in the woman&rsquo;s fat face, and would
      have given worlds to slap it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a nurse in the hospital who showed more bright and cheerful
      spirits when the patients were being prepared for the night. But next
      morning, in the gray dawn, when she had dragged herself to bed, and was
      able at length to be alone, she beat the pillows with both hands and
      sobbed in her loneliness and shame.

    </h2>
    <p>
      But youth is rich in hope, and at noon, when Glory awoke, the thought of
      Drake flashed upon her like light in a dark place. He had compelled Lord
      Robert to assist Polly in a worse extremity, and he would assist her in
      her present predicament. How often he had hinted that the hospital was not
      good enough for her, and that some day and somewhere Fate would find other
      work for her and another sphere. The time had come; she would appeal to
      him, and he would hasten to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to revive the magnificent dreams that had floated in her mind
      for months. No need to tell the people at home of her dismissal and
      disgrace; no need to go back to the island. She would be somebody in her
      own right yet. Of course, she would have to study, to struggle, to endure
      disappointments, but she would triumph in the end. And when at length she
      was great and famous she would be good to other poor girls; and as often
      as she thought of John Storm in his solitude in his cell, though there
      might be a pang, a red stream running somewhere within, she would comfort
      herself with the thought that she, too, was doing her best; she, too, had
      her place, and it was a useful and worthy one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that time came, however, there would be managers to influence and
      engagements to seek, and perhaps teachers to pay for. But Drake was rich
      and generous and powerful; he had a great opinion of her talents, and he
      would stop at nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaping out of bed, she sat down at the table as she was and wrote to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Drake: Try to see me to-night. I want your advice immediately.
      What do you think? I have got myself &lsquo;noticed&rsquo; at last, and as a
      consequence I am to leave at the end of my term. So things are urgent, you
      see. I &lsquo;wave my lily hand&rsquo; to you. Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;save time I suggest the hour and the place: eight o&rsquo;clock, St.
      James&rsquo;s Park, by the bridge going down from Marlborough House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake received this note as he was sitting alone in his chambers smoking a
      cigarette after drinking a cup of tea, in that hour of glamour that is
      between the lights. It seemed to bring with it a secret breath of passion
      out of the atmosphere in which it had been written. At the first impulse
      it went up to his lips, but at the next moment he was smitten by the
      memory of something, and he thought: &ldquo;I will do what is right; I will play
      the game fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dined that night with a group of civil servants at his club in St.
      James&rsquo;s Street, but at a quarter to eight, notwithstanding some playful
      bantering, he put on his overcoat and turned toward the park. The autumn
      night was soft and peaceful; the stars were out and the moon had risen; a
      fragrant mist came up from the lake, and the smoke of his cigar was hardly
      troubled by the breeze that pattered the withered tassels of the
      laburnums. Big Ben was striking eight as he reached the end of the little
      bridge, and almost immediately afterward he was aware of soft and hurrying
      footsteps approaching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory had come down by the Mall. The whispering of the big white trees in
      the moonlight was like company, and she sang to herself as she walked. Her
      heart seemed to have gone into her heels since yesterday, for her step was
      light and sometimes she ran a few paces. She arrived out of breath as the
      great clock was striking, and seeing the figure of a gentleman in evening
      dress by the end of the bridge, she stopped to collect herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand was hot and a little damp when Drake took it, and her face was
      somewhat flushed. She had all at once become ashamed that she had come to
      ask him for anything, and she took out her pocket-handkerchief and began
      to roll it in her palms. He misunderstood her agitation, and trying to
      cover it he offered her his arm and took her across the bridge, and they
      turned westward down the path that runs along the margin of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Storm has gone,&rdquo; she said, thinking to explain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it generally known, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a letter from him yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not mind if he says things, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, Glory. I set them down to the egotism of the religious man. The
      religious man can not believe that anybody can live a moral life and act
      on principle except from the religious impulse.... I suppose he has warned
      you against me, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at a loss to know what I&rsquo;ve done to deserve it. But time must justify
      me. I am not a religious man myself, you know, though I hate to talk of
      it. To tell you the truth, I think the religious idea a monstrous egotism
      altogether, and the love of God merely the love of self. Still, you must
      judge for yourself, Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we not wasting our time a little?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am here; isn&rsquo;t that
      proof enough of my opinion?&rdquo; And then in an agitated whisper she added: &ldquo;I
      have only half an hour, the gates will be closing, and I want to ask your
      advice, you know. You remember what I told you in my letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He patted the hand on his arm and said, &ldquo;Tell me how it happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him everything, with many pauses, expecting every moment that he
      would break in upon her and say, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you box the woman&rsquo;s ears?&rdquo; or
      perhaps laugh and assure her that it did not matter in the least, and she
      was making too much of a mere bagatelle. But he listened to every
      syllable, and after she had finished there was silence for a moment. Then
      he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;very sorry; in fact, I am much troubled about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her nerves were throbbing hard and her hand on his arm was twitching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had left of your own accord after that scene in the board room, it
      would have been so different&mdash;so easy for me to help you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have spoken to my chief&mdash;he is a governor of many hospitals&mdash;and
      said, &lsquo;A young friend of mine, a nurse, is uncomfortable in her present
      place and would like to change her hospital.&rsquo; It would have been no sooner
      said than done. But now&mdash;now there is the black book against you, and
      God knows if ... In fact, somebody has laid a trap for you, Glory,
      intending to get rid of you at the first opportunity, and you seem to have
      walked straight into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt stunned. &ldquo;He has forgotten all he has said to me,&rdquo; she thought.
      In a feeble, expressionless voice she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked some steps in silence. &ldquo;He is turning it over,&rdquo; she thought.
      &ldquo;He will tell me how to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, as if seized by a new idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell them where you had been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, in the same weak voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not do so? There is hope in that. The chaplain was your friend&mdash;your
      only friend in London, so far as they know. Surely that is an extenuating
      circumstance so plausible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is bitter to explain&mdash;to apologize&mdash;and if I can do
      it for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not allow it!&rdquo; she said. Her lips were set, and her breath was
      coming through them in gusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity to allow the hospitals to be closed against you. Nursing is
      a good profession, Glory&mdash;even a fashionable one. It is true womanly
      work, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? John Storm? He was right. Indeed, he was an entirely honourable and
      upright man, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>you</i> always seemed to say there were other things more worthy
      of a girl, and if she had a mind to&mdash;&mdash; But no matter. We
      needn&rsquo;t talk about the hospitals any longer. I am not fit for them and
      shall never go back to them, whatever happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her. She was biting her lips, and the tears were
      gathering in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, never mind, dear,&rdquo; he said, and he patted her hand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon had begun to wane, and out of the dark shadows they walked in
      they could see the lines of houses lit up all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said, with a feeble laugh, &ldquo;in all this great busy London is
      there nothing else I&rsquo;m fit for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fit for anything in the world, my dear,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her nerves were throbbing harder than ever. &ldquo;Perhaps he doesn&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo;
       she thought. Should she tell him what he said so often about her talents,
      and how much she might be able to make of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing a girl can do except go down on her knees to a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and talked some nonsense about the kneeling. &ldquo;Poor little
      woman, she doesn&rsquo;t know what she is doing,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind what people thought of me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not even my own
      people, who have been brought up with such narrow ideas, you know. They
      might think what they liked, if I felt I was in the right place at last&mdash;the
      right place for me, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her nervous fingers were involuntarily clutching at his coat sleeve. &ldquo;Now,
      any other man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to cry. &ldquo;He <i>won&rsquo;t</i> remember,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;It was
      only his way of being agreeable when he praised me and predicted such
      wonderful things. And now his good breeding will not allow him to tell me
      there are hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of girls in London as
      likely to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you mustn&rsquo;t cry, Glory. It&rsquo;s not so bad as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had never seemed to him so beautiful, and he wanted to take her in his
      arms and comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no one but you to come to,&rdquo; she murmured in her confusion. But she
      was thinking: &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stop me before? Why have you let me go on
      all these months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must try to think of something, and I&rsquo;ll speak to my friend Rosa&mdash;Miss
      Macquarrie, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man,&rdquo; said Glory, &ldquo;and I thought perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But she
      could not speak of her fool&rsquo;s paradise now, she was so deeply ashamed and
      abased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the difficulty, my dear. If I were not a man, I might so
      easily help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did he mean? The frogs kept croaking at the margin of the lake,
      disturbed by the sound of their footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you were to tell me to do I should do it,&rdquo; she said, in the same
      confused murmur. She was ruining herself with every word she uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew up and stood before her, so close that she could feel his breath,
      on her face. &ldquo;My dear Glory,&rdquo; he said passionately, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think it isn&rsquo;t
      terrible to me to renounce the happiness of helping you, but I must not, I
      dare not, I will not take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could scarcely breathe for the shame that took sudden hold of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows I would give anything to have the joy of looking after your
      happiness, dear, but I should despise myself forever if I took advantage
      of your circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Good God! What did he think she had been asking of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking of yourself, Glory, because I want to esteem you and honour
      you, and because your good name is above everything else&mdash;everything
      else in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her shame was now abject. It stifled her, deafened her, blinded her. She
      could not speak or hear or see.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay&mdash;do not go yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But with a cry like the cry of a startled bird she disappeared in the
      shadow of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment where she had left him, tingling in every nerve, wanting
      to follow her, and overtake her, and kiss her, and abandon everything. But
      he buttoned up his overcoat and turned away, telling himself that whatever
      another man might have done in the same case he at least had done rightly,
      and that men like John Storm were wrong if they thought it was impossible
      to act on principle without the impulse of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Glory was flying through the darkness and weeping in the
      bitterness of her disappointment and shame. The big trees overhead were
      all black now and very gaunt and grim, and the breeze was moaning in their
      branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had disgrace enough already,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;I might have spared myself
      a degradation like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake had supposed that she came to plead for herself to-night as she had
      pleaded for Polly a week ago. How natural that he should think so! How
      natural and yet how hideous!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate him! I hate him!&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had been right. In their heart of hearts these men of society
      had only one idea about a girl, and she had stumbled on it unawares. They
      never thought of her as a friend and an equal, but only as a dependent and
      a plaything, to be taken or left as they liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how shameful to be a woman&mdash;how shameful, how shameful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Drake had renounced her! In the hideous tangle of his error he had
      renounced her! For honour&rsquo;s sake, and her own sake, and for sake of his
      character as a gentleman&mdash;renounced her! Oh, there was somebody who
      would never have renounced her whatever had happened, and yet she had
      driven him away, and he was gone forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate myself! I hate myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remembered how often out of recklessness and daring and high spirits,
      but without a thought of evil, she had broken through the barrier of
      manners and given Drake occasion to think lightly of her&mdash;at the
      ball, at the theatre, at tea in his chambers, and by dressing herself up
      as a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate myself! I hate myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was right, and Drake in his different way was right too, and
      she alone had been to blame. But Fate was laughing at her, and the jest
      was very, very cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. It is all for the best,&rdquo; she thought. She would be the
      stronger for this experience&mdash;the stronger and the purer too, to
      stand alone and to face the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got back to the hospital just as the great clock of Westminster was
      chiming the half-hour, and she stood a moment on the steps to listen to
      it. Only half an hour had passed, and yet all the world had changed!

    <h2>
      XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the last day of Glory&rsquo;s probation, and, dressed in the long blue
      ulster in which she came from the Isle of Man, she was standing in the
      matron&rsquo;s room waiting for her wages and discharge. The matron was sitting
      sideways at her table, with her dog snarling in her lap. She pointed to a
      tiny heap of gold and silver and to a foolscap paper which lay beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your month&rsquo;s salary, nurse, and this is your &lsquo;character.&rsquo; The
      &lsquo;character&rsquo; has given me a deal of trouble. I have done all I could for
      you. I have said you were bright and cheerful, and that the patients liked
      you. I trust I have not committed myself too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory gathered up the money, but left the &ldquo;character&rdquo; untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be anxious, ma&rsquo;am; I shall not require it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a situation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where are you going next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money have you saved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three months&rsquo; wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only three pounds altogether!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be quite sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What friends have you got in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None&mdash;that is to say&mdash;no, none whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you go back to your island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t wish to be a burden upon my people, and because earning
      my living in London doesn&rsquo;t depend on the will or the whim of any woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you. I might have dismissed you instantly, but for the
      sake of the chaplain I&rsquo;ve borne with your rudeness and irregularities, and
      even tried to be your friend, and yet&mdash;&mdash; I dare say you&rsquo;ve not
      even told your people why you are leaving the hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t told them yet that I&rsquo;m leaving at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve a great mind to do it for you. A venturesome, headstrong girl
      who flings herself on London is in danger of ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Glory, opening the door to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory stood at her full height and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if you said that of me there is nobody in the world would believe
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her box had been brought down to the hall, and the porter, who wished to
      be friendly, was cording it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I leave it in your care, porter, until I am able to call for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certingly, nurse. Sorry you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll miss your face, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll call for my letters also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one just come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was from Aunt Anna, and was full of severe reproof and admonition.
      Glory was not to think of leaving the hospital; she must try to be content
      with the condition to which God had called her. But why had her letters
      been so few of late? and how did it occur that she had never told them
      about Mr. Storm? He had gone for good into that strange Brotherhood, it
      seemed. Not Catholic, and yet a monastery. Most extraordinary! They were
      all eagerly waiting to hear more about it. Besides, the grandfather was
      anxious on Glory&rsquo;s account. If half they heard was true, the dangers of
      London&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The house-surgeon came down to say good-bye. He had always been as free
      and friendly as Sister Allworthy would allow. They stood a moment at the
      door together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere&mdash;nowhere&mdash;everywhere; to &lsquo;all the airts the wind can
      blaw.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a clear, bright morning, with a light, keen frost. On looking out,
      Glory saw that flags were flying on the public buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? It&rsquo;s the ninth of November&mdash;Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed merrily. &ldquo;A good omen. I&rsquo;m the female Dick Whittington! Here
      goes for it! Good-bye, hospital nursing.&mdash;By-bye, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped him a playful curtsy at the bottom of the steps, and then
      tripped along the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a girl it is!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;And what is to become of her in this
      merciless old London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had taken less than a score of steps from the hospital when blinding
      teardrops leaped from her eyes and ran down her cheeks; but she only
      dropped her veil and walked on boldly.

    <p>
      The Society of the Holy Gethsemane, popularly called the Bishopsgate
      Fathers, was one of the many conventual institutions of the English Church
      which came as a sequel to the great upheaval of religious feeling known as
      the Tractarian or Oxford movement. Most of them gave way under the
      pressure of external opposition, some of them broke down under the strain
      of internal dissension, and a few lived on as secret brotherhoods, in
      obedience to a rule which was never divulged by their members, who were
      said to wear a hair shirt next the skin and to scourge themselves with the
      lash of discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these conventual institutions the Society of the Holy Gethsemane had
      been one of the earliest, and it was now quite the oldest, although it had
      challenged not only the traditions of the Reformed Church but the spirit
      of the age itself by establishing its place of prayer at the very doors of
      the Stock Exchange&mdash;that crater of volcanic emotions, that generating
      house for the electric currents of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its founder and first Superior had been a man of iron will, who had fought
      his way through ecclesiastical courts and popular anger, and even family
      persecution, which had culminated in an effort of his own brother to shut
      him up as a lunatic. His first disciple and most stanch supporter had been
      the Rev. Charles Frederic Lamplugh, a fellow of Corpus, newly called to
      orders after an earlier career which had been devoted to the world, and,
      according to rumour, nearly wrecked in an affair of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the community had proved its legal right to exist within the
      Establishment and public clamour had subsided, this disciple was
      despatched to America, and there he established a branch brotherhood and
      became great and famous. At the height of his usefulness and renown he was
      recalled, and this exercise of authority provoked a universal outcry among
      his admirers. But he obeyed; he left his fame and glory in America and
      returned to his cell in London, and was no more heard of by the outer
      world until the founder of the society died, when he was elected by the
      brothers to the vacant place of Superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Lamplugh was now a man of seventy, so gentle in his manner, so
      sweet in his temper, so pious in his life, that when he stepped out of his
      room to greet John Storm on his arrival in Bishopsgate Street it seemed as
      if he brought the air of heaven in the rustle of his habit, and to have
      come from the holy of holies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome! welcome!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew you would come to us; I have been
      expecting you. The first time I saw you I said to myself: &lsquo;Here is one who
      bears a burden; the world can not satisfy the cravings of a heart like
      that; he will surrender it some day.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having been there before, though in &ldquo;Retreat&rdquo; only, he entered at once
      into the life of the Brotherhood. It was arranged that he was to spend
      some two or three months as postulant, then to take the vow of a novice
      for one year, and finally, if he proved his vocation, to seal and
      establish his calling by taking the three life vows of poverty, chastity,
      and obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The home of the Brotherhood was one of those old London mansions in the
      heart of the city, which were built perhaps for the palaces of dignitaries
      of the Church, and were afterward occupied as the houses and offices of
      London merchants and their apprentices, and have eventually descended to
      the condition of warehouses and stores and tenement dwellings for the
      poor. Its structure remained the same, but the brothers made no effort to
      support its ancient grandeur. Nothing more simple can be imagined than the
      appointments of their monastery. The carved-oak staircase was there, but
      the stairs wore carpetless, and the panelled and parqueted hall was bare
      of ornament, except for a picture, in a pale oaken frame, of the head of
      Christ in its crown of thorns. A plain clock in a deal case was nailed up
      under the floral cornice, and beneath it there hung the text: &ldquo;Lord, who
      shall dwell in thy tabernacle, or who shall rest upon thy holy hill? Even
      he that leadeth an uncorrupt life.&rdquo; The old dining-room was now the
      community room, the old kitchen was the refectory, the spacious bedrooms
      were partitioned into cells, and the corridors, which had once been
      covered with tapestry, were now coated with whitewash, and bore the
      inscription, &ldquo;Silence in the passages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this house of poverty and dignity, of past grandeur and present
      simplicity, the brothers lived in community. They were forty in number,
      consisting of ten lay brothers, ten novices, and twenty professed Fathers.
      The lay brothers, who were under the special direction of their own
      Superior, the Father Minister, and were rarely allowed to go into the
      street, had to clean the house and bake the bread and cook and serve the
      food which was delivered at the door, and thus, in that narrow circle of
      duty, they proved their piety by their devotion to a lot which condemned
      them to scour and scrub to the last day of life. The clerical brothers,
      who were nearly all in full orders, enjoyed a more varied existence, being
      confined to the precincts only during a part of their novitiate, and then
      sent out at the will of the Superior to preach in the churches of London
      or the country, and even despatched on expeditions to establish missions
      abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lay brothers had their separate retiring room, but John Storm met his
      clerical housemates on the night of his arrival. It was the hour of
      evening recreation, and they were gathered in the community room for
      reading and conversation. The stately old dining-room was as destitute as
      the corridors of adornments or even furniture. Straw armchairs stood on
      the clean, white floor; a bookcase, containing many volumes of the
      Fathers, lined one of the panelled walls; and over the majestic fireplace
      there was a plain card with the inscription, &ldquo;There be eunuchs which have
      made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers gathered about him and examined him with a curiosity which
      was more than personal. To this group of men, detached from life, the
      arrival of some one from the outer world was an event of interest. He knew
      what wars had been waged, what epidemics were raging, what Governments had
      risen and fallen. He might not speak of these things in casual talk, for
      it was against rule to discuss, for its own sake, what had been seen or
      heard outside, but they were in the air about him, and they were happening
      on the other side of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he on his part also examined his housemates, and; tried to guess what
      manner of men they were and what had brought them to that place. They were
      men of all ages, and nearly every school of the Church had sent its
      representatives. Here was the pale face of the ascetic, and there the
      guileless eyes of the saint. Some were keen and alert, others were timid
      and slow. All wore the long black cassock of the community, and many wore
      the rope with three knots. They spoke little of the world outside, but it
      was clear that they could not dismiss it from their thoughts. Their talk
      was cheerful, and the Father told stories of his preaching expeditions
      which provoked some laughter. They had no newspapers (except one
      well-known High-Church organ) and no games, and there was no smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang for supper, and they went down to the refectory. It was a
      large apartment in the basement, and it still bore the emblems of its
      ancient service. Over the great kitchen ingle there was yet another card
      with the inscription, &ldquo;Neither said any of them that aught of the things
      which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.&rdquo; A
      table, scoured white, ran round three sides of the room, the seats were
      forms without backs, and there was one chair&mdash;the Superior&rsquo;s chair&mdash;in
      the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper consisted of porridge and milk and brown bread, and it was
      eaten out of plates and cans of pewter. While it lasted one of the
      brothers, seated at a raised desk, read first a few passages of Scripture,
      and then some pages, of a secular book which the religious were thus
      hearing at their meals. The supper was hardly over when the bell rang
      again. It was time for Compline, the last service of the day, and the
      brothers formed in procession and passed out of the house, across the
      courtyard, into the little church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old place was dimly lighted, but the brothers occupied the chancel
      only. They sat in two companies on opposite sides of the choir, in three
      rows of stalls, the lay brothers in front, the novices next, and the
      Fathers at the back. Each side had its leader in the recitation of the
      prayers. The Miserere was said kneeling, the Psalms were sung with
      frequent pauses, each of the duration of the words &ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; producing
      the effect of a broken wail. The service was short, and it ended with &ldquo;May
      the Lord Almighty grant us a quiet night and a perfect end.&rdquo; There was
      another stroke of the bell, and the brothers returned to the house in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm walked with the Superior, and passing through the courtyard, in
      the light of the moon that had risen while they were at prayers, he was
      startled by the sound of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the creaking of the sycamore,&rdquo; said the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had thought it was the voice of Glory, but he had been hearing her cry
      throughout the service, so he dismissed the circumstance as a dream. Half
      an hour later the household had retired for the night, the lights were put
      out, and the Society of the Gethsemane was at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s cell was on the topmost floor, next to the quarters of the lay
      brothers. There was nothing above it but a high lead flat, which was
      sometimes used by the religious as watch-tower and breathing place. The
      cell was a narrow room with bare floor, a small table, one chair, a
      prayingstool, a crucifix, and a stump bed, having a straw pillow and a
      crimson coverlet marked with a large white cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;my journey is at an end. This is my resting-place for
      life.&rdquo; The mighty hand of the Church was on him and he felt a deep peace.
      He was like a ship that had been tossed at sea and was lying quiet in
      harbour at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without was the world, the fantastic world, forever changing; within were
      gentle if strict rules and customs securely fixed. Without was the
      ceaseless ebb and flow of the financial tide; within were content and
      sweet poverty and no disturbing fears. Without were struggle and strife
      and the fever of gain; within were peace and happiness and the grand
      mysteries which God reveals to the soul in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to pass his life in review and to think: &ldquo;Well, it is all over,
      at all events. I shall never leave this place. Friends who forgive me,
      good-bye! And foes who are unforgiving, good-bye to you too!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the world&mdash;the great, vain, cruel, hypocritical world&mdash;farewell
      to it also! Farewell to its pomp and its glory! Farewell to life, and
      liberty, and&mdash;love&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind was rustling the leaves of the tree in the courtyard, and he
      could not help but hear again the voice he had heard when crossing from
      the church. His eyes were closed, but Glory&rsquo;s face, with its curling and
      twitching lip and its laughing and liquid eyes, was printed on the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; he murmured; and saying this again and again, he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the daylight had not quite dawned when he was awakened by a
      knock at his door and a low voice saying, &ldquo;Benedicamus Domino!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the Father Superior, who made it his rule to rouse the household
      himself, on the principle of &ldquo;whosoever will be chief among you, let him
      be your servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deo Gratias,&rdquo; he answered, and the voice went on through the corridor.
      Then the bell rang for Lauds and Prime, and John left his cell to begin
      his life as Brother Storm.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Though it was against the rule of the Order to indulge in particular
      friendships, yet in obedience to the rule of Nature he made friends among
      the brothers. His feeling for the Superior became stronger than love and
      approached to adoration, and there were certain of the Fathers to whom his
      heart went out with a tender sympathy. The Father Minister was a man of a
      hard, closed soul, very cantankerous and severe; but the rest were gentle
      and timid men for the most part, with a wistful outlook on the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was due in part to the proximity of his cell to the quarters assigned
      to the lay brothers that his two closest friendships were made among them.
      One was with a great creature, like an overgrown boy, who kept the door to
      the monastery by day, and alternated that duty with another by night. He
      was called Brother Andrew&mdash;for the lay brothers were known by their
      Christian names&mdash;and he was one of those characterless beings who are
      only happy when they have merged their individuality in another&rsquo;s and
      joined their fate to his. He attached himself to John from the first, and
      as often as he was at liberty he was hanging about him, ready to fetch and
      carry in his shambling gait, which was like the roll of an old dog. The
      expression of his beardless face was that of a boy, and he had no
      conversation, for he always agreed with everything that was said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other of John&rsquo;s friendships was with the lay brother whom he had known
      outside&mdash;the brother of Polly Love&mdash;but this was a friendship of
      slower growth, impeded by a tragic obstacle. John had seen him first in
      the refectory on the night of his arrival, and observed in his face the
      marks of suffering and exhaustion. At various times afterward he had seen
      him in the church and encountered him in the corridors, and had sometimes
      bowed to him and smiled, but the brother had never once given sign of
      recognition. At length he had begun to doubt his identity, and one
      morning, going upstairs from breakfast side by side with the Superior, he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, is the lay brother with the melancholy eyes and the pale face the
      one whom I knew at the hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Father; &ldquo;but he is under the rule of silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Does he know what has become of his sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the morning hour of recreation, and the Father drew John into the
      courtyard and talked of Brother Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was much tormented by thoughts of the world without, and being a young
      man of a weak nervous system and a consumptive tendency, such struggles
      with the evil one were hurtful to him. Therefore, though it was the rule
      that a lay brother should not be consecrated until after long years of
      service, it had been decided that he should take the vows immediately, in
      order that Satan might yield up his hold of him and the world might drag
      at him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your experience?&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;when a religious has taken the
      vows, are his thoughts of the world all conquered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is like the sailor making ready for his voyage. As long as he lies in
      harbour his thoughts are of the home he has left behind him; but when he
      has once crossed the bar and is out on the ocean he thinks only of the
      haven where he would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are there no backward glances, Father? The sailor may write to the
      friends he has parted from&mdash;surely the religious may pray for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As brothers and sisters of the spirit, yes, always and at all times; as
      brothers and sisters of the flesh, no, never, save in hours of especial
      need. He is the spouse of Christ, my son, and all Christ&rsquo;s children are
      his kindred equally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a last word the Father begged of John to abstain from reference to
      anything that had happened at the hospital, lest Brother Paul might hear
      of it and manifold evils be the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warning seemed needless. From that day forward John tried to avoid
      Brother Paul. In church and in the refectory he kept his eyes away from
      him. He could not see that worn face, with its hungry look, and not think
      of a captured eagle with a broken wing. It was with a shock that he
      discovered that their cells were side by side. If they came near to each
      other in the corridors he experienced a kind of terror, and was thankful
      for the rule of silence which forbade them to speak. Under the smouldering
      ashes there might be coals of fire which only wanted a puff to fan them
      into flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came face to face at last. It was on the lead flat of the tower above
      their cells. John had grown accustomed to go there after Compline, that he
      might look on London from that eminence and thank God that he had escaped
      from its clutches. The stars were out, and the city lay like a great
      monster around and beneath. Something demoniacal had entered into his view
      of it. Down there was the river, winding like a serpent through its sand,
      and here and there were the bridges, like the scales across it, and
      farther west was the head of the great creature, just beginning to be
      ablaze with lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is there,&rdquo; he thought, and then he was startled by a sound. Had he
      uttered the words aloud? But it was some one else who had spoken. Brother
      Paul was standing by the parapet with his eyes in the same direction. When
      he became conscious that John was behind him he stammered something in his
      confusion, and than hurried away as if he had been detected in a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God pity him!&rdquo; thought John. &ldquo;If he only knew what has happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going back to his cell, he began to think of Glory. By the broken links of
      memory he remembered for the first time, since coming into the monastery,
      the condition of insecurity in which he had left her. How uncertain her
      position at the hospital, how perilous her relations with her friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      The last prayer of the day for the brothers of the Gethsemane was the
      prayer before the crucifix by the side of the bed: &ldquo;Thanks be to God for
      giving me the trials of this day!&rdquo; To this he added another petition: &ldquo;And
      bless and protect her wheresoever she may be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased to frequent the tower after that, and did not go up to it again
      until the morning of the day on which he was to make his vows. By this
      time his soul had spent itself so prodigally in prayer that he had almost
      begun to regard himself as one already in another world. The morning was
      clear and frosty, and he could see that something unusual was taking place
      on the earth below. Traffic was stopped, the open spaces were crowded, and
      processions were passing through the streets with bands of music playing
      and banners flying. Then he remembered what day it was&mdash;it was Lord
      Mayor&rsquo;s Day, the 9th of November&mdash;and once again he thought of Glory.
      She would be there, for her heart was light and she loved the world and
      all its scenes of gaiety and splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the day of his final preparation, and he was under the rule of
      silence, so he returned to his cell and shut the door. But he could not
      shut out the sounds of the streets. All day long the bands were playing
      and the horses prancing, and there was the tramp of many feet. And even in
      the last hour before the ceremony, when he was on his knees in front of
      the crucifix and the palms of his hands were pressed against his face, he
      could see the gay spectacle and the surging throngs&mdash;the men, the
      women, the children in every window, on every parapet, and Glory in the
      midst of them with her laughing lips and her sparkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night brought peace with it at length, and then the bell rang and he went
      down to service. The brothers were waiting for him in the hall, and they
      formed into line and passed into the church: first, Brother Andrew with
      the cross, then Brother Paul with the incense, and the other lay brothers
      with the candles, then the religious in their cassocks, and the Superior
      in his cope, and John Storm last of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The altar was decorated as for a feast, and the service was strange but
      solemn. John had drawn up in writing a promise of stability and obedience,
      and this he placed with his own hand on the altar. Down to that moment he
      had worn his costume as a secular priest, but now he was to be robed in
      the habit of the Order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father stood on the altar steps with the habit lying at his feet. He
      took it up and blessed it and then put it on John, saying as he bound it
      with the cord, &ldquo;Take this cord and wear it in memory of the purity of
      heart wherewith you must ever hereafter seek to abide in the love and
      service of our Lord Jesus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a door was suddenly and loudly slammed, to signify that the
      world was being shut out; the choir said the Gloria Patri, and then sang a
      hymn beginning:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Farewell, thou world of sorrow,
    Unrest, and schism and strife!
  I leave thee on the threshold
    Of the celestial life.

    <p>
      It was the occasion of Brother Paul&rsquo;s life vows also, and as John stood
      back from the altar steps the lay brother was brought up to them. He was
      very pale and nervous, and he would have stumbled but for the help of the
      Father Minister and Brother Andrew, who walked on either side of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the same ceremony was gone through again, but with yet more solemn
      accessories. The burial service was read, the De Profundis was sung, the
      bell was tolled, the Ecce quam bonum was intoned, and finally the chant
      was chanted:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Dead to Him, then death is over,
  Dead and gone are death&rsquo;s dark fears.
</pre>
    <p>
      John Storm was profoundly stirred. The heavens seemed to open and all the
      earth to pass away. It was difficult to believe that he was still in the
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was able to collect himself he was on the tower again, but in his
      cassock now and gripping the cord by which it was tied. The frosty air of
      the morning had thickened to a fog, the fog-signals were sounding, and the
      mighty monster below seemed to be puffing fire from a thousand nostrils
      and bellowing from a thousand throats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one had come up to him. It was Brother Paul. He was talking nervously
      and even pretending to laugh a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so happy to see you here. And I am glad the silence is at an end and
      I am able to tell you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said John, and he tried to pass him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always knew you would come to us&mdash;that is to say, after the night
      I heard you at the hospital&mdash;the night of the Nurses&rsquo; Ball, you
      remember, and the Father&rsquo;s visit, you know. Still, I trust there was
      nothing wrong&mdash;nothing at the hospital, I mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was fumbling for the door to the dormer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody loved you too&mdash;the patients and the nurses and everybody!
      How they will miss you there! I trust you left everybody well&mdash;and
      happy and&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said John from the head of the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, and then the brother said, in another
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand you. I know quite well what you mean. It is a fault to
      speak of the outer world except on especial need. We have taken the vows,
      too, and are pledged for life&mdash;I am, at all events. Still, if you
      could have told me anything&mdash;&mdash; But I am much to blame. I must
      confess my fault and do my penance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was diving down the stair and hurrying into his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help him!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;And me too! God help both of us! How am I to
      live if I have to hide this secret? Yet how is he to live if he learns
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat on the bed and tried to compose himself. Yes, Brother Paul was an
      object for pity. In all the moral universe there was no spectacle more
      pitiable than that of a man who had left the world while his heart was
      still in it. What was he doing here? What had brought him? What business
      had such a one in such a place? And then his pitiful helplessness for all
      the uses of life and duty! Could it be right, could it be necessary, could
      it be God&rsquo;s wish and will?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a man whose sister was in the world. She was young and vain, and
      the world was gay and seductive. Without a hand to guide and guard her,
      what evils might not befall? She was sunk already in shame and
      degradation, and he had put it out of his power to save her. Whatever had
      happened in the past, whatever might happen in the future, he was lost to
      her forever. The captured eagle with the broken wing was now chained to
      the wall as well. But prayer! Prayer was the bulwark of chastity, and God
      was in need of no man&rsquo;s efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      John fell on his knees before the crucifix. With the broken logic of
      reverie he was thinking of Glory, and Brother Paul, and Polly and Drake.
      They crossed his brain and weighed upon it and went out and returned. The
      night was cold, but the sweat stood on his brow in beads. In the depths of
      his soul something was speaking to him, and he was trying not to listen.
      He was like a blind man who had stumbled to the edge of a precipice, and
      could hear the waves breaking on the rocks beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said his last prayer that night he omitted the petition for Glory
      (as duty seemed to require of him), and then found that all life and soul
      and strength had gone out of it. In the middle of the night he awoke with
      a sense of fright. Was it only a dream that he was dead and buried? He
      raised his head in the darkness and stretched out his hand. No, it was
      true. Little by little he pieced together the incidents of the previous
      day. Yes, it had really happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, I am not like Paul&mdash;I am not bound for life,&rdquo; he told
      himself, and then he lay back like a child and was comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ashamed, but he could not help it; he was feeling already as if he
      were a prisoner in a dungeon looking forward to his release.

      &ldquo;5a Little Turnstile, High Holborn, London, W. C., November 9, 18&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yiz, oh yiz, oh yiz! This is to announce to you with due pomp and
      circumstance that I, Glory Quayle, am no longer at the hospital&mdash;for
      the present. Did I never tell you? Have you never noticed it in the
      regulations? Every half-year a nurse is entitled to a week&rsquo;s holiday, and
      as I have been exactly six months to-day at Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, and as a
      week is too short a time for a trip to the &lsquo;oilan,&rsquo; [* Island.] and as a
      good lady whose acquaintance I have made here had given me a pressing
      invitation to visit her&mdash;&mdash; See?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being the first day since I came up to London that I have been sole
      mistress of my will and pleasure, I have been letting myself loose, like
      Caesar does the moment his mad hoofies touch the grass. I must tell you
      all about it. The day began beautifully. After a spell of laughing and
      crying weather, and all the world sneezing and blowing its nose, there
      came a frosty morning with the sun shining and the air as bright as
      diamonds. I left the hospital between, eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock, and
      crossing the park by Birdcage Walk I noticed that flags were flying on
      Buckingham Palace and church bells ringing everywhere. It turned out to be
      the birthday of the Prince of Wales, and the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day as well, and
      by the time I got to Storey&rsquo;s Gate bands of music were playing and people
      were scampering toward the Houses of Parliament. So I ran, too, and from
      the gardens in front of Palace Yard I saw the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what that is, good people? It is a civic pageant. Once a year
      the City King makes a royal procession through the streets with his
      soldiers and servants and keepers and pipers and retainers, bewigged and
      bepowdered and bestockinged pretty much as they used to be in the days
      before the flood. There have been seven hundred of him in succession, and
      his particular vanity is to show that he is wearing the same clothes
      still. But it was beautiful altogether, and I could have cried with
      delight to see those grave-looking signiors forgetting themselves for once
      and pretending they were big boys over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a sight! Flags were flying everywhere and festoons were stretched
      across the streets with mottoes and texts, such as &lsquo;Unity is strength&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;God save the Queen,&rsquo; and other amiable if not original ideas. Traffic was
      stopped in the main thoroughfares, and the &lsquo;buses were sent by devious
      courses, much to the astonishment of the narrow streets. Then the crowds,
      the dense layers of potted people with white, upturned faces, for all the
      world like the pictures of the round stones standing upright at the
      Giant&rsquo;s Causeway&mdash;it was wonderful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then the fun! Until the procession arrived the policemen were really
      obliging in that way. The one nearest me was as fat as Falstaff, and a
      slim young Cockney in front kept addressing intimate remarks to him and
      calling him Robert. The young impudence himself was just as ridiculous,
      for he wore a fringe which was supported by hair-oil and soap, and rolled
      carefully down the right side of his forehead so that he could always keep
      his left eye on it. And he did, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the pageant itself! My gracious! how we laughed at it! There were
      Epping Forest verderers, and beef-eaters from the Tower, and pipers of the
      Scots Guards, and ladies of the ballet shivering on shaky stools and
      pretending to be &lsquo;Freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;Commerce,&rsquo; and last of all the City King
      himself, smiling and bowing to all his subjects, and with his liegemen
      behind him in yellow coats and red silk stockings. Perhaps the most
      popular character was a Highlander in pink tights, where his legs ought to
      have been, walking along as solemnly as if he thought it was a sort of
      religious ceremony and he was an idol out for an airing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then the bands! There must have been twenty of them, both brass and
      fife, and they all played the Washington Post, but no two had the luck to
      fall on the same bar at the same moment. It was a medley of all the tunes
      in music, an absolute kaleidoscope of sounds, and meantime there was the
      clash of bells from the neighbouring belfries in honour of the Prince&rsquo;s
      birthday, and the rattle of musketry from the Guards, so that when the
      double event was over I felt like the man whose wife presented him with
      twins&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t have lost either of them for a million of money,
      but I couldn&rsquo;t have found it in my heart to give a bawbee for another one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The procession took half an hour to pass, and when it was gone,
      remembering the ladies in lovely dresses who had rolled by in their
      gorgeous carriages, looking not a bit cleverer or handsomer than other
      people, I turned away with a little hard lump at my heart and a limp in my
      left foot&mdash;the young Cockney with the fringe had backed on to my toe.
      I suppose they are feasting with the lords and all the nobility at the
      Guildhall to-night, and no doubt the crumbs that fall from the rich man&rsquo;s
      table will go in pies and cakes to the alleys and courts where hunger
      walks, and I dare say little Lazarus in the Mile End Road is dreaming at
      this very moment of Dick Whittington and the Lord Mayor of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been some waking dream of that sort which took possession of
      me also, for what do you suppose I did? Shall I tell you? Yes, I will. I
      said to myself: &lsquo;Glory, my child, suppose you were nearly as poor as he
      was in this great, glorious, splendid London; suppose&mdash;only suppose&mdash;you
      had no home and no friends, and had left the hospital, or perhaps even
      been turned away from it, and hadn&rsquo;t a good lady&rsquo;s door standing open to
      receive you, what would you do first, my dear?&rsquo; To all which I replied
      promptly, &lsquo;You would first get yourself lodgings, my child, and then you
      would just go to work to show this great, glorious London what a woman can
      do to bring it to her little feet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know grandfather is saying, &lsquo;Gough bless me, girl! you didn&rsquo;t try it,
      though?&rsquo; Well, yes, I did&mdash;just for fun, you know, and out of the
      spirit of mischief that&rsquo;s born in every daughter of Eve. Do you remember
      that Manx cat that wouldn&rsquo;t live in the house, notwithstanding all the
      bribes and corruption of Aunt Rachel&rsquo;s new milk and softened bread, but
      went off by the backyard wall to join the tribe of pariah pussies that
      snatch a living how they may? Well, I felt like Rumpy for once, having
      three &lsquo;goolden sovereigns&rsquo; in my pocket and a mind superior to fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was glorious fun altogether, and the world is so amusing that I can&rsquo;t
      imagine why anybody should go out of it before he must. I hadn&rsquo;t gone a
      dozen yards in my new character as Dick Whittington <i>fille</i> before a
      coachman as fat as an elephant was shouting, &lsquo;Where d&rsquo;ye think yer going
      ter?&rsquo; and I was nearly run down in the Broad Sanctuary by a carriage
      containing two brazen women in sealskin jackets, with faces so thick with
      powder and paint that you would have thought they had been quarrelling on
      washing day and thrown the blue bag at each other&rsquo;s eyes. I recognised one
      of them as a former nurse who had left the hospital in disgrace, but
      happily she didn&rsquo;t see me, for the little hard lump at my heart was
      turning as bitter as gall at that moment, so I made some philosophical
      observations to myself and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my gracious, these London landladies! They must be female Shylocks,
      for the pound of flesh is the badge of all their tribe. The first one I
      boarded asked two guineas for two rooms, and lights and fires extra. &lsquo;By
      the month?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Yus, by the month if ye like,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;Two guineas
      a month?&rsquo; says I. Marry come up! I was out of that house in a twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I looked out a group of humbler thoroughfares, not far from the
      Houses of Parliament, where nearly every house had a card fixed up on a
      little green blind. At last I found a place that would do&mdash;for my
      week, only my week, you know. Ten shillings and no extras. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take
      them,&rsquo; said I with a lofty air, and thereupon the landlady, a grim person,
      with the suspicion of a mustache, began to cross-examine me. Was I
      married? Oh, dear, no! Then what was my business? Fool that I was, I said
      I had none, being full of my Dick Whittingtonism, and not choosing to
      remember the hospital, for I was wearing my private clothes, you know. But
      hoot! She didn&rsquo;t take unmarried young ladies without businesses, and I was
      out in the street once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mind it, not I indeed, and it was only for fun after all; but
      since people objected to girls without businesses, I made up my mind to be
      a singer if anybody asked me the question again. My third landlady had
      only one room, and it was on the second floor back, but before I got the
      length of mounting to this eyry I went through my examination afresh. &lsquo;In
      the profession, miss?&rsquo; &lsquo;What profession?&rsquo; &lsquo;The styge, of course.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,
      ye&mdash;yes, something of that sort.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tyke anybody that&rsquo;s on the
      styge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I could have screamed, it was so ridiculous; but time
      was getting on, Big Ben was striking four, and the day was closing in.
      Then I saw the sign, &lsquo;Home for Girls.&rsquo; &lsquo;Wonder if it is a charity?&rsquo; thinks
      I; but no, it didn&rsquo;t look like that, so in I went as bold as brass, and
      inquired for the manageress. &lsquo;Is it the matron you mean, miss?&rsquo; &lsquo;Very
      well, the matron then,&rsquo; said I, and presently she came up&mdash;no, not
      smiling, for she wasn&rsquo;t an amiable-looking Christian, but I thought she
      would smother me with mysterious questions. &lsquo;Tired of the life, are you,
      my dear? It <i>is</i> a cruel one, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; I stood my ground for some
      minutes, and then, feeling dreadfully thick in the throat, and cold down
      the back, I asked her what she was talking about, whereupon she looked
      bewildered and inquired if I was a good girl, and being told that I hoped
      so, she said she couldn&rsquo;t take me in there, and then pointed to a card oh
      the wall which, simpleton that I was, I hadn&rsquo;t read before: &lsquo;A home and
      rescue is offered to women who desire to leave a life of misery and
      disgrace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>did</i> scream that time, the world was so nonsensical. At one
      place, being &lsquo;on the styge&rsquo; I was not good enough to be taken in, at
      another I was not bad enough, and what in the name of all that was
      ridiculous was going to happen next? But it was quite dark by this time,
      the air was as black as a northwest gale, and I was &lsquo;aweary for all my
      wings,&rsquo; so forgetting Dick Whittington <i>fille</i>, and only remembering
      the good female Samaritan who had asked me to stay with her, I made a dart
      for Victoria Street and jumped into the first &lsquo;bus that came along, just
      as the hotels and the clubs and the great buildings were putting&rsquo; out the
      Prince of Wales&rsquo;s feathers as sign and symbol of the usual rejoicings
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an &lsquo;Atlas&rsquo; omnibus, and it took me to Piccadilly Circus, and that
      being the wrong direction, I had to change. But a fog had come down in the
      meanwhile, and lo, there I was in the middle of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Ananias, Azarias, and Misael! Do you know what a London fog is? It&rsquo;s
      smoke, it&rsquo;s soot, it&rsquo;s sulphur. It is darker than night, for it
      extinguishes the lights, and denser than the mist on the Curragh, and
      filthier than the fumes of the brick-kiln. It makes you think the whole
      round earth must be a piggery copper and that London has lifted the lid
      off. In the midst of this inferno the cabs crawl and the &lsquo;buses creep, and
      foul fiends, who turn out to be men merely, go flitting about with
      torches, and you grope and croak and cough, and the most innocent faces
      come puffing and snorting down on you like the beasts in the Apocalypse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it good fun at first, but presently I could only keep from
      crying by having a good laugh, and I was doing that, and asking somebody
      the way to the Holborn omnibus, when a policeman pushed me and said:
      &lsquo;Come, move on; none of yer lyterin&rsquo; abart here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have choked, but remembering something I had seen on that very
      spot on the night of my first day out, I dived across the street and ran
      in spite of curses and collisions. But the &lsquo;somebody,&rsquo; whoever he was, had
      followed me, and he put me into the right &lsquo;bus, so I got here at last. It
      took two mortal hours to do it, and after that spell of purgatory this
      house is like a blessed paradise, peopled with angels of mercy and grace,
      as paradise ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good Samaritan was very kind, and she made tea for me in a twinkling
      and slaughtered the fatted calf in the shape of a pot of raspberry jam.
      Her name is Mrs. Jupe, and her husband is something in a club, and she has
      one child of eleven, whose bedfellow I am to be, and here I am now with
      Miss Slyboots in our little bedroom feeling safe and sound and monarch of
      all I survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, good people! Half an hour hence I&rsquo;ll be going through a mad
      march of the incidents of the day, turned topsy-turvy according to the way
      of dreams. But wae&rsquo;s me! wae&rsquo;s me! If it had all been true&mdash;if I had
      been really homeless and friendless and penniless, instead of having three
      &lsquo;goolden&rsquo; pounds in my purse, and Providence in the person of Mrs. Jupe,
      to fall back upon! When I grow to be a wonderful woman and have brought
      the eyes of all the earth upon me, I am going to be good to poor girls who
      have no anchorage in London. John Storm was right: this great, glorious,
      brilliant, delightful London can be very cruel to them sometimes. It calls
      to them, beckons to them, smiles on them, makes them think there must be
      joy in the blaze of so much light and luxury and love by the side of so
      many palaces, and then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps the mischief lies deeper down; and though I&rsquo;m not going to
      cut my hair and wear a waistcoat and stand up for the equal rights of the
      sexes, I feel at this moment that if I were only a man I should be the
      happiest woman in the world, God bless me! Not that I am afraid of London,
      not I indeed; and to show you how I long to take a header into its
      turbulent tides, I hereby warn and apprize and notify you that perhaps I
      may use my week&rsquo;s holiday to find a more congenial employment than that of
      deputy White Owl at the hospital. I am not in my right place yet, Aunt
      Anna, notwithstanding, so look out for revelations! &lsquo;To be or not to be?
      that is the question.&rsquo; Just say the word and I&rsquo;ll leave it to Providence,
      which is always a convenient legatee, and in any case&mdash;but wait, only
      wait and see what a week will bring forth!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greet the island for me to the inmost core of its being. The dear little
      &lsquo;oilan!&rsquo; Now that I am so far away, I go over it in my mind&rsquo;s eye with the
      idiotic affection of a mother who knows every inch of her baby&rsquo;s body and
      would like to gobble it. The leaves must be down by this time, and there
      can be nothing on the bare boughs but the empty nests where the little
      birdies used to woo and sing. My love to them and three tremendous kisses
      for yourselves!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Oh, haven&rsquo;t I given you the &lsquo;newses&rsquo; about John Storm? There
      are so many things to think about in a place like London, you see. Yes, he
      has gone into a monastery&mdash;communication cut off&mdash;wires broken
      down by the &lsquo;storm,&rsquo; etc. Soberly, he has gone for good seemingly, and to
      talk of it lightly is like picking a penny out of a blind man&rsquo;s hat. Of
      course, it was only to be expected that a man with an upper lip like that
      should come to grief with all those married old maids and elderly women of
      the opposite sex. Canons to right of him, canons to left of him, canons in
      front of him&mdash;but rumour says it was John himself who volleyed and
      thundered. He wrote me a letter when he was on the point of going, saying
      how London had shocked and disappointed him, and how he longed to escape
      from it and from himself at the same time, that he might dedicate his life
      to God. It was right and true, no doubt; but wherefore could not I
      pronounce Amen? He also mentioned something about myself, how much I had
      been to him; for he had never known his mother, and had never had a
      sister, and could never have a wife. All which was excellent, but a mere
      woman like Glory doesn&rsquo;t want to read that sort of thing in a letter, and
      would rather have five minutes of John Storm the man than a whole eternity
      of John Storm the saint. His letter made me think of Christian on his way
      to the eternal city; but that person has always seemed to me a doubtful
      sort of hero anyway, taking Mrs. Christian into account and the various
      little Christians, and I can&rsquo;t pity him a pin about his bundle, for he
      might just as well have left behind him what he couldn&rsquo;t enjoy of God&rsquo;s
      providence himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is like hitting a cripple with his crutch, John being gone and
      past all defending himself, and when I think of it in the streets I have
      to run to keep myself from doing something silly, and then people think
      I&rsquo;m chasing an omnibus, when I&rsquo;m really only chasing my tears. I can&rsquo;t
      tell you much about the Brotherhood. It looks like a cross between a
      palace and a penitentiary, and it appears that ritualism has gone one
      better than High-Churchmanship, and is trying to introduce the monastic
      system, which, to an ordinary woman of the world, seems well enough for
      the man in the moon, though the man in the moon might have a different way
      of looking at things. They say the brothers are all celibates and live in
      cells, but I think I&rsquo;ve seen a look in John Storm&rsquo;s eyes that warns me
      that he wasn&rsquo;t intended for &lsquo;the lek o&rsquo; that&rsquo; exactly. To tell you the
      truth, I half blame myself for what has happened, and I am ashamed when I
      remember how jauntily I took matters all the time our poor John was
      fighting with beasts at Ephesus. But I am vexed with him too; and if only
      he had waited patiently before taking such a serious step in order to hear
      <i>my</i> arguments&mdash;&mdash; But no matter. A jackdaw isn&rsquo;t to be
      called a religious bird because it keeps a-cawing on the steeple, and John
      Storm won&rsquo;t make himself into a monk by shutting himself up in a cell.
      Good-night.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The house to which Glory had fled out of the fog was a little dingy
      tobacconist&rsquo;s shop opening on a narrow alley that runs from Holborn into
      Lincoln&rsquo;s-Inn Fields. It was kept by the baby farmer whom she had met at
      the house of Polly Love, and the memory of the address thrust upon her
      there had been her only resource on that day of crushing disappointment
      and that night of peril. Mrs. Jupe&rsquo;s husband, a waiter at a West End club,
      was a simple and helpless creature, very fond of his wife, much deceived
      by her, and kept in ignorance of the darker side of her business
      operations. Their daughter, familiarly called &ldquo;Booboo,&rdquo; a silent child
      with cunning eyes and pasty cheeks, was being brought up to help in the
      shop and to dodge the inspector of the school board.
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming downstairs next morning to the close and dingy parlour at the
      back, Glory had looked about her as one who had expected something she did
      not see, whereupon Mrs. Jupe, who was at breakfast with her husband, threw
      up her little twinkling eyes and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I know what she&rsquo;s a-lookin&rsquo; for; it&rsquo;s the byeby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gorn, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not dead, but I &lsquo;ad to put it out, pore thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, miss,&rdquo; said Mr. Jupe with his mouth full, &ldquo;my missus couldn&rsquo;t
      nurse the byeby and &lsquo;tend to the biziniss as well, so as reason was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It brikes my &lsquo;eart to think it; but it made such a n&rsquo;ise, pore darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the mother know?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t necessary, my dear. It&rsquo;s gorn to a pusson I can trust to tyke
      keer of it, and I&rsquo;m trooly thenkful&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It jest amarnts to this, miss: the biziness is too much for the missus as
      things is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t keer if my &lsquo;ealth was what it used to be, in the dyes when I
      &lsquo;ad Booboo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t, and she&rsquo;s often said as how she&rsquo;d like a young laidy to
      live with her and &lsquo;elp her with the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice-lookin&rsquo; girl might &lsquo;ave a-many chawnces in a place syme as this,
      my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd, yus; and when I seen the young laidy come in at the door, &lsquo;Strike
      me lucky!&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;the very one!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syme &lsquo;ere, my dear. I reckkernized ye the minute I seen ye; and if ye
      want to leave the hospital and myke a stawt, as you were saying&mdash;last
      night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory stopped them. They were on the wrong trace entirely. She had merely
      come to lodge with them, and if that was not agreeable&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and so ye shell, my dear; and if ye don&rsquo;t like the shop all at
      onct, there&rsquo;s Booboo, she wants lessons&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can pay,&rdquo; said Glory, and then she was compelled to say something
      of her plans. She wanted to become a singer, perhaps an actress, and to
      tell them the truth she might not be staying long, for when she got
      engagements&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest as you like, my dear; myke yerself at &lsquo;ome. On&rsquo;y don&rsquo;t be in a &lsquo;urry
      about engygements. Good ones ain&rsquo;t tots picked up by the childring in the
      streets these dyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless it was agreed that Glory was to lodge at the tobacconist&rsquo;s,
      and Mr. Jupe was to bring her box from the hospital on coming home that
      night from his work. She was to pay ten shillings a week, all told, so
      that her money would last four or five weeks, and leave something to
      spare. &ldquo;But I shall be earning long before that,&rdquo; she thought, and her
      resources seemed boundless. She started on her enterprise instantly,
      knowing no more of how to begin than that it would first be necessary to
      find the office of an agent. Mr. Jupe remembered one such place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in a street off of Waterloo Road,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the name on the
      windows is Josephs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory found this person in a fur-lined coat and an opera hat, sitting in a
      room which was papered with photographs, chiefly of the nude and the
      semi-nude, intermingled with sheafs of playbills that hung from the walls
      like ballads, from the board of the balladmonger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, vot&rsquo;s yer line?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory answered nervously and indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vot can you do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could sing and recite and imitate people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;My terms are two guineas down and ten per
      cent on salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory rose to go. &ldquo;That is impossible. I can not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vait a minute. How much have you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that my business, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touchy, ain&rsquo;t ye, miss? But if you mean bizness, I&rsquo;ll tyke a guinea and
      give you the first chawnce what comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly, fearfully, distrustfully, Glory paid her guinea and left her
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddle doo,&rdquo; said the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she found herself in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two weeks less for lodgings,&rdquo; she thought, as she returned to the
      tobacconist&rsquo;s. But Mrs. Jupe seemed entirely satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell ye, my dear? Good engygements ain&rsquo;t chasing nobody abart
      the streets these dyes, and there&rsquo;s that many girls now as can do a song
      and a dance and a recitashing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three days passed, four days, five days, six days, a week, and still no
      word from Mr. Josephs. Glory called on him again. He counselled patience.
      It was the dead season at the theatres and music halls, but if she only
      waited&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited a week longer and then called again, and again, and yet again.
      But she brought nothing back except her mimicry of the man&rsquo;s manner. She
      could hit him off to a hair&mdash;his raucous voice, his guttural
      utterance, and the shrug of his shoulders that told of the Ghetto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jupe shrieked with laughter. That lady&rsquo;s spirits were going up as
      Glory&rsquo;s came down. At the end of the third week she said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t abear
      to tyke yer money no longer, my dear, you not doing nothink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she hinted at a new arrangement. She had to be much from home. It was
      necessary; her health was poor&mdash;an obvious fiction. During her
      absence she had to leave Booboo in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t good for the child, my dear, and it ain&rsquo;t good for the shop; but
      if anybody syme as yerself would tyke a turn behind the counter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having less than ten shillings in her pocket, Glory was forced to submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a considerable traffic through the little turnstile. Lying
      between Bedford Row and Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, it was the usual course of lawyers
      and lawyers&rsquo; clerks passing to and fro from the courts. They were not long
      in seeing that a fresh and beautiful face was behind the counter of the
      dingy little tobacco-shop. Business increased, and Mrs. Jupe became
      radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell ye, my dear? There&rsquo;s more real gentlemen a-mooching rahnd
      here in a day than a girl would have a chawnce of meeting in a awspital in
      a twelvemonth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s very soul was sickening. The attentions of the men, their easy
      manners, their little liberties, their bows, their smiles, their
      compliments&mdash;it was gall and wormwood to the girl&rsquo;s unbroken spirit.
      Nevertheless she was conscious of a certain pleasure in the bitterness.
      The bitterness was her own, the pleasure some one else&rsquo;s, so to speak, who
      was looking on and laughing. She felt an unconquerable impulse to sharpen
      her wit on Mrs. Jupe&rsquo;s customers, and even to imitate them to their faces.
      They liked it, so she was good for business both ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she remembered John Storm and felt suffocated with shame. Her thoughts
      turned to him constantly, and she called at the hospital to ask if there
      were any letters. There were two, but neither of them was from Bishopsgate
      Street. One was from Aunt Anna. Glory was not to dream of leaving the
      hospital. With tithes going down every year, and everything else going up,
      how could she think of throwing away a salary and adding to their
      anxieties? The other was from her grandfather:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to hear you have had a holiday, dear Glory, and trust you are
      feeling the better for the change. Must confess to being a little startled
      by the account of your adventure on Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day, with the wild scheme
      for cutting adrift from the hospital and taking London by storm. But it
      was just like my little witch, my wandering gipsy, and I knew it was all
      nonsense; so when Aunt Anna began to scold I took my pipe and went
      upstairs. Sorry to hear that John Storm has gone over to Popery, for that
      is what it comes to, though he is not under the Romish obedience. I am the
      more concerned because I failed to make his peace with his father. The old
      man seems to blame me for everything, and has even taken to passing me on
      the road. Give my best respects to Mrs. Jupe, when you see her again, with
      my thanks for taking care of you. And now that you are alone in that great
      and wicked Babylon, take good care of yourself, my dear one. To know that
      my runaway is well and happy and prosperous is all I have left to
      reconcile me to her absence. Yes, the harvest is over and threshed and
      housed, and we have fires in the parlour nearly every day, which makes
      Anna severe sometimes, coals being so dear just now, and the turf no
      longer allowed to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was ten days overdue. That night, in her little bedroom, with its low
      ceiling and sloping floor, Glory wrote her answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t nonsense, my dear grandfather, and I really have left the
      hospital. I don&rsquo;t know if it was the holiday and the liberty or what, but
      I felt like that young hawk at Glenfaba&mdash;do you remember it?&mdash;the
      one that was partly snared and came dragging the trap on to the lawn by a
      string caught round its leg. I had to cut it away, I had to, I had to! But
      you mustn&rsquo;t feel one single moment&rsquo;s uneasiness about me. An able-bodied
      woman like Glory Quayle doesn&rsquo;t starve in a place like London. Besides, I
      am provided for already, so you see my bow abides in strength. The first
      morning after my arrival Mrs. Jupe told me that if I cared to take to
      myself the style and title of teacheress to her little Slyboots I had only
      to say the word and I should be as welcome as the flowers in May. It isn&rsquo;t
      exactly first fiddling, you know, and it doesn&rsquo;t bring an ambassador&rsquo;s
      salary, but it may serve for the present, and give me time to look about.
      You mustn&rsquo;t pay too much attention to my lamentations about being
      compelled by Nature to wear a petticoat. Things being so arranged in this
      world I&rsquo;ll make them do. But it does make one&rsquo;s head swim and one&rsquo;s wings
      droop to see how hard Nature is on a woman compared to a man. Unless she
      is a genius or a jelly-fish there seems to be only one career open to her,
      and that is a lottery, with marriage for the prizes, and for the blanks&mdash;oh
      dear, oh dear! Not that I have anything to complain of, and I hate to be
      so sensitive. Life is wonderfully interesting, and the world is such an
      amusing place that I&rsquo;ve no patience with people who run away from it, and
      if I were a man&mdash;but wait, only wait, good people!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Storm had made one other friend at Bishopsgate Street&mdash;the dog
      of the monastery. It was a half-bred bloodhound, and nobody seemed to know
      whence he came and why he was there. He was a huge, ungainly, and most
      forbidding creature, and partly for that reason, but chiefly because it
      was against rule to fix the affections on earthly things, the brothers
      rarely caressed him. Unnoticed and unheeded, he slept in the house by day
      and prowled through the court by night, and had hardly ever been known to
      go out into the streets. He was the strictest monk in the monastery, for
      he eyed every stranger as if he had been Satan himself, and howled at all
      music except the singing in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing John for the first time, he broadened his big flews and
      stiffened his thick stern, according to his wont with all intruders, but
      in this instance the intruder was not afraid. John patted him on the
      peaked head and rubbed him on the broad nose, then opened his mouth and
      examined his teeth, and finally turned him on his back and tickled his
      chest, and they were fast friends and comrades forever after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some weeks after the dedication they were in the courtyard together, and
      the dog was pitching and plunging and uttering deep bays which echoed
      between the walls like thunder at play. It was the hour of morning
      recreation, between Terce and Sext, and the religious were lolling about
      and talking, and one lay brother was sweeping up the leaves that had
      fallen from the tree, for the winter had come and the branches were bare.
      The lay brother was Brother Paul, and he made sidelong looks at John, but
      kept his head down and went on with his work without speaking. One by one
      the brothers went back to the house, and John made ready to follow them,
      but Paul put himself in his way. He was thinner than before, and his eyes
      were red and his respiration difficult. Nevertheless, he smiled in a
      childlike way, and began to talk of the dog. What life there was in the
      old creature still! and nobody had known, there was so much play in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not feeling so well, are you?&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so well,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day is cold, and this penance is too much for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that. I asked for it, you know, and I like it. It&rsquo;s
      something else. To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m very foolish in some ways. When
      I&rsquo;ve got anything on my mind I&rsquo;m always thinking. Day and night it&rsquo;s the
      same with me, and even work&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His breathing was audible, but he tried to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what it is this time? It&rsquo;s what you said on the roof on the
      night of the vows, you remember. What you didn&rsquo;t say, I mean&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s just the trouble. It was wrong to talk of the world without great
      necessity, but if you had been able to say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; when I asked if everybody
      was well you would have done it, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not talk of that now,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it would be the same fault as before. Still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How keen the air is! And your asthma is so troublesome! You must really
      let me speak to the Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;m used to it. But if you know yourself what it is
      to be always thinking of anybody&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John called to the dog, and it capered about him. &ldquo;Good-morning, Brother
      Paul.&rdquo; And he went into the house. The lay brother leaned on his besom and
      drew a long sigh that seemed to come from the depths of his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      John had hastened away, lest his voice should betray him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awful!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It must be awful to be always thinking of somebody,
      and in fear of what has happened to her. Poor little Polly! She&rsquo;s not
      worthy of it, but what does that matter? Blood is blood and love is love,
      and only God is stronger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few days afterward the air darkened and softened, and snow began to
      fall. Between Vespers and Evensong John went up to the tower to see London
      under its mantle of white. It was like an Eastern city now under an
      Eastern moonlight, and he was listening to the shouts and laughter of
      people snowballing in the streets when he heard a laboured step on the
      stair behind him. It was Brother Paul coming up with a spade to shovel
      away the snow. His features were pinched and contracted, and his young
      face was looking old and worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really must not do it,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;To work like this is not penance,
      but suicide. I&rsquo;ll speak to the Father, and he&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t; for mercy&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t! Have some pity, at all events! If you
      only knew what a good thing work is for me&mdash;how it drives away
      thoughts, and stifles&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so useless, Brother Paul. Look! The snow is still falling, and
      there&rsquo;s more to come yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, it&rsquo;s good for me. When I&rsquo;m very tired I can sleep
      sometimes. And then God is good to you if you don&rsquo;t spare yourself. Some
      day perhaps he&rsquo;ll tell me something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tell us everything in his own good time, Brother Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to counsel patience. If I were like you I should be counting
      the days until my time was over, and that would help me to bear things.
      But when you are dedicated for life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped at his work and looked over the parapet, and seemed to be
      gazing into the weary days to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anybody of your own out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean any&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any relative&mdash;any sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know what it is; that&rsquo;s why you won&rsquo;t give me an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Brother Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might only make you the more uneasy if I told you what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lay brother let his spade fall, then slowly, very slowly, picked it up
      again and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. You needn&rsquo;t say any more. I shall never ask you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang for Evensong, and John hurried away. &ldquo;If it were only some
      one who was deserving of it!&rdquo; he thought&mdash;&ldquo;some one who was worthy
      that a man should risk his soul to save her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At supper and in church he saw Brother Paul going about like a man in a
      waking dream, and when he went up to bed he heard him moving restlessly in
      the adjoining cell. The fear of betraying himself was becoming unbearable,
      and he leaped up and stepped out into the corridor, intending to ask the
      Superior to give him another room elsewhere. But he stopped and came back.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not brave,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not kind, it&rsquo;s not human,&rdquo; and, saying
      this again and again, as one whistles when going by a haunted house, he
      covered his ears and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night, while it was still quite dark, he was awakened
      by a light on his face and the sense of some one looking down on him in
      his sleep. With a shudder he opened his eyes and saw Brother Paul, candle
      in hand, standing by the bed. His eyes were red and swollen, and when he
      spoke his voice was full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a fault to come into anybody else&rsquo;s cell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I
      would rather do my penance than endure this torture. Something has
      happened&mdash;I can see that quite well; but I don&rsquo;t know what it is, and
      the suspense is killing me. The certainty would be easier to bear; and I
      swear to you by Him who died for us that if you tell me I shall be
      satisfied! Is she dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; said John by a sudden impulse, and then there was an awful
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dead!&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Then would to God that she were dead, for it must
      be something worse, a thousand times worse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John felt as if the secret had been stolen from him in his sleep; but it
      was gone, and he could say nothing. Brother Paul&rsquo;s lips trembled, his
      respiration quickened, and he turned away and smote his head against the
      wall and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it all the time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Her sister went the same way, and I
      could see that she was going too, and that was why I was so anxious. Oh,
      my poor mother! my poor mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For two days after that John saw no more of Brother Paul. &ldquo;He is doing his
      penance somewhere,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the snow was still falling, and when the brothers went out to
      Lauds at 6 A.M. they passed through a cutting of snow which was banked up
      afresh every morning, though the day had not then dawned. On the third day
      John was the first to go down to the hall, and there he met Brother Paul,
      with his spade in his hands, coming out of the courtyard. He looked like a
      man who was melting before a fire as surely as a piece of wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry now that I told you,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Paul hung his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy to see that you are suffering more than ever; and it is all my
      fault. I will go to the Father and confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between breakfast and Terce John carried out this intention. The Superior
      was sitting before a handful of fire, in a little room that was darkened
      by leather-bound books and by the flakes of snow which were falling across
      the window panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I am a cause of offence to another brother, and it
      is I who should be doing his penance.&rdquo; And then he told how he had broken
      the observance which forbids any one to talk of his relations with the
      world without
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father listened with great solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your temptation is a testimony to the reality of the
      religious life. Satan&rsquo;s rage against the home of consecrated souls is
      terrible, and he would fain break in upon it if he could with worldly
      thoughts and cares and passions. But we must conquer him by his own
      weapons. Your penance, my son, shall be of the same kind with your
      offence. Go to the door and take the place of the doorkeeper, and stay
      there day and night until the end of the year. Thus shall the evil one be
      made aware that you are the guardian of our house, to be tampered with no
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother Andrew was troubled when John took his place at the door that
      night, but John himself was unconcerned. He was doorkeeper to the
      household, so he began on the duties of his menial position. As the
      brothers passed in and out on their mission-errands he opened the door and
      closed it. If any one knocked he answered, &ldquo;Praise be to God!&rdquo; then slid
      back the little grating in the middle panel of the door and looked out at
      the stranger. The hall was a chill place, with a stone floor, and he sat
      on a form that stood against one of its walls. His bed was in an alcove
      which had formerly been the cloak-room, and a card hung over it with the
      inscription, &ldquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord.&rdquo; He had no company
      except big Brother Andrew, who stole down sometimes to cheer him with his
      speechless presence, and the dog, which was always hanging about.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was at least some comfort to be out of the proximity of Brother Paul.
      The sounds of the lay brother in the neighbouring cell had brought back
      recollections of Glory, and he had more than he could do to conquer his
      thoughts of her. Since he had taken his vows and had ceased to mention her
      in his prayers she had been always with him, and his fears for her fate
      had been pricked and goaded by the constant presence of Brother Paul&rsquo;s
      anxieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it was some loss that he could not go to the church,
      and he remembered with a pang how happy he had been after a night of
      terrors when he had gone into God&rsquo;s house in the morning and cast his
      burden on him with one yearning cry of &ldquo;God bless all women and young
      children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now the Christmas season, and his heart tingled and thrilled as the
      brothers passed through the door at midday and talked of the women who
      attended the Christmas services. Were they really so calm as they seemed
      to be, and had they conquered their natural affections?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes during the midday service he would slide back the grating and
      listen for the women&rsquo;s voices. He heard one voice in all of them, but he
      knew it was only a dream. Then he would watch the snow falling from the
      little patch of dun-coloured sky crossed by bars, and tell himself that
      that was all he was to see of the world henceforth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky emptied itself at last, and Brother Paul came again to shovel away
      the snow. He was weaker than ever, for the wax was melting away. When he
      began to work, his chest was oppressed and his face was feverish. John
      snatched the spade out of his hand and fell to doing his work instead of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to see it, and I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Father&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;you can tell him if you like. You are killing yourself
      by inches, and you are a failing man any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I really dying?&rdquo; said Brother Paul, and he staggered away like one who
      had heard his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked after, him and thought: &ldquo;Now what should I do if I were in
      that man&rsquo;s place? If the case were Glory&rsquo;s, and I fixed here as in a
      vice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was ashamed when he thought of Glory like that, and he dismissed the
      idea, but it came back with mechanical obstinacy and he was compelled to
      consider it. His vows? Yes, it would be death to his soul to break them.
      But if she were lost who had no one but him to look to&mdash;if she went
      down to wreck and ruin, then the fires of hell would be as nothing to his
      despair!
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Paul came to him next day and sat on the form by his side and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m really dying, what am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you like to do, Brother Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to go out and find her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good would there be in that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could say something that would stop her and put an end to everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wild light came into his eyes and he answered, &ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John played the hypocrite and began to counsel patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a man can&rsquo;t live without hope and not go mad,&rdquo; said Brother Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must trust and pray,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But God never answers us. If it were your own case what would you do? If
      some one outside were lost&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should go to the Father and say, &lsquo;Let me go in search of her.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Brother Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? The Father is kind and tender and he loves his children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I <i>will</i> do it,&rdquo; said Paul, and he made for the Father&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got to the door of the cell and then came back again. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t look in his face and
      ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here and I&rsquo;ll ask for you,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      John made three hasty strides and then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he will not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;God&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was morning, and the Superior was reading in his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, my son,&rdquo; he said, and he laid his book on his lap. &ldquo;This is a
      book you must read some day&mdash;the Inner Life of Père Lacordaire. Most
      fascinating! An inner life of intolerable horror until he had conquered
      his natural affections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;one of our lay brothers has a little sister in the
      world and she has fallen into trouble. She has gone from the place where
      he left her, and God only knows where she is now! Let him go out and find
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Paul&mdash;and she is all he has, and he can not help but think
      of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a temptation of the evil one, my son. Brother Paul has newly
      taken the vows and so have you. The vows are a challenge to the powers of
      evil, and it is only to be expected that he who takes them will be tested
      to the uttermost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Father, she is young and thoughtless. Let him go out and find her
      and save her, and he will come back and praise God a thousand times the
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The temptations of Satan are very subtle; they come in the guise of duty.
      Satan is tempting our brother through love, and you, also, through pity.
      Let us turn our backs on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is impossible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When John returned to the door Brother Paul was standing by the alcove
      gazing with wet eyes on the text hanging above the bed. He saw his answer
      in John&rsquo;s face, and they sat down on the form without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang for service and the religious began to pass through the
      hall. As the Father was crossing the threshold Brother Paul flung himself
      down at his feet and clutched his cassock and made a frantic appeal for
      pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, have pity upon me and let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father&rsquo;s eyes became moist but his will remained unshaken. &ldquo;As a man I
      ought to have pity,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and as the Father of all of you I should be
      kind to my children; but it is not I who refuse you, it is God, and I
      should be guilty of a sin if I let you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Paul burst into mad laughter and the religious gathered round and
      looked at him in astonishment. There was foam on his lips and fire in his
      eyes, and he threw up his hands and fell back fainting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father made the sign of the cross on his breast and his lips moved in
      silence for a moment. Then he said to John, who had raised the lay brother
      in his arms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him there. Damp his forehead and hold his hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning to the religious he added: &ldquo;I ask the prayers of the community
      for our poor brother. Satan is fighting for his soul. Let us wrestle in
      prayer that we may expel the spirit that possesses him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment John was alone with the unconscious man, except for the
      dog which was licking his forehead. And looking after the Superior, he
      told himself that such unlimited power over the body and soul of another
      the Almighty could have meant for no man. The love of God and the fear of
      the devil had swallowed up the love of man and stifled all human
      affections. Such religion must have hardened the best man ever born. As
      for the poor broken creature lying there so still, his vows had been made
      to heaven, and to heaven alone his obedience was due. The nature within
      him had spoken too loudly, but there were laws of Nature which it was a
      sin to resist. Then why should he resist them? The cry of blood was the
      voice of God, or God had no voice and He could speak to no man. Then, why
      should he not listen?
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Paul recovered consciousness and raised his head. The waves of
      memory flowed back upon him and his eyes flamed and his lips trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go if I have to break my vows!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need for that,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I will let you out at night and let you in again in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then these two crushed and fettered souls, bound by no iron bonds,
      confined by no bolts and bars, but only under the shadow of the
      supernatural, sat together like prisoners in a dungeon concocting schemes
      for their escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Father locks the outer gate himself,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Where does he keep
      the key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his own room on a nail above his bed,&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the lay brother attending to him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Andrew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Andrew will do anything for me,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the dog?&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;He is always in the court at night, and he
      barks at the sound of a step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not my step,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send you to some one who can find your sister. You&rsquo;ll tell her you
      come from me and she&rsquo;ll take you with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could hear the singing in the church, and they paused to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I come back in the morning I&rsquo;ll confess everything and do my
      penance,&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I too,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had come out with a sudden gleam and the thawing snow was dripping
      from the trees in drops like diamonds. The singing ceased, the service
      ended, and the brothers came back to the house. When the Father entered,
      Paul was clothed and in his right mind and sitting quietly on the form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for this answer to our prayers!&rdquo; said the Father. &ldquo;But you must
      pray without ceasing lest Satan should conquer you again. Until the end of
      the year say your Rosary in the church every night alone from Compline to
      midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to John he said with a smile: &ldquo;And you shall be like the
      anchoret of old to this household, my son. We monks pray by day, but the
      anchoret prays by night. Unless we know that in the dark hours the
      anchoret guards the house, who shall rest on his bed in peace?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the end of the fourth week, after Glory had paid her fee to the agent,
      she called on him again. It was Saturday morning, and the vicinity of his
      office was a strange and surprising scene. The staircase and passages to
      the house, as well as the pavement of the streets far as to the
      public-house at the corner, were thronged with a gaudy but shabby army of
      music-hall artistes of both sexes. When Glory attempted to pass through
      them she was stopped by a cry of, &ldquo;Tyke yer turn on Treasury day, my
      dear,&rdquo; and she fell back and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one they passed upstairs, came down again with cheerful faces,
      shouted their adieus and disappeared. Meanwhile they amused themselves
      with salutations, all more or less lively and familiar, told stories and
      exchanged confidences, while they danced a step or stamped about to keep
      away the cold. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve chucked the slap [* Rouge.] on with a mop this
      morning, my dear,&rdquo; said one of the girls. &ldquo;Have I, my love? Well, I was a
      bit thick about the clear, so I thought it would keep me warm.&rdquo; &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t
      no use facing the doner of the casa with that,&rdquo; said a man who jingled a
      few coins as he came downstairs, and away went two to the public-house.
      Sometimes a showy brougham would drive up to the door and a magnificent
      person in a fur-lined coat, with diamond rings on both hands, would sweep
      through the lines and go upstairs. When he came down again his carriage
      door would be opened by half a dozen &ldquo;pros&rdquo; who would call him &ldquo;dear old
      cully&rdquo; and tell him they were &ldquo;down on their luck&rdquo; and &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t done a turn
      for a fortnight.&rdquo; He would distribute shillings and half-crowns among
      them, cry &ldquo;Ta-ta, boys,&rdquo; and drive away, whereupon his pensioners would
      stroke their cuffs and collars of threadbare astrakhan, tip winks after
      the carriage, and say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than crying cabbages in Covent
      Garden, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Then they would all laugh knowingly, and one would say,
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it to be, cully?&rdquo; and somebody would answer, &ldquo;Come along to
      Poverty Point then,&rdquo; and a batch of the waiting troop would trip off to
      the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the gorgeous kind was coming down the stairs when his eye fell on
      Glory as she stood in a group of girls who were decked out in rose pink
      and corresponding finery. He paused, turned back, reopened the office
      door, and said in an audible whisper, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the pretty young ginger
      you&rsquo;ve got here, Josephs?&rdquo; A moment afterward the agent had come out and
      called her upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s salary day, my dear&mdash;vait there,&rdquo; he said, and he put her into
      an inner room, which was tawdrily furnished in faded red plush, with piano
      and coloured prints of ballet girls and boxing men, and was full of the
      odour of stale tobacco and bad whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited half an hour, feeling hot and ashamed and troubled with
      perplexing thoughts, and listening to the jingle of money in the adjoining
      room, mingled with the ripple of laughter and sometimes the exchange of
      angry words. At length the agent came back, saying, &ldquo;Vell, vat can I do
      for you to-day, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been drinking, his tone was familiar, and he placed himself on the
      end of the sofa upon which Glory was seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory rose immediately. &ldquo;I came to ask if you have heard of anything for
      me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard anything? Not yet, my dear. You must vait&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve waited long enough, and if your promises amount to anything
      you&rsquo;ll get me an appearance at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I vould, my dear. I vould get you an extra turn at the Vashington, but
      it&rsquo;s very expensive, and you&rsquo;ve got no money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you take what I had if you can do nothing? Besides, I don&rsquo;t
      want anything but what my talents can earn. Give me a letter to a manager&mdash;for
      mercy&rsquo;s sake, do something for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a shrug of the Ghetto as the man rose and said, &ldquo;Very vell, if
      it&rsquo;s like that, I&rsquo;ll give you a letter and velcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat at a table and wrote a short note, sealed it carefully in an
      envelope which was backed with advertisements, then gave it to Glory, and
      said, &ldquo;Daddle doo. You&rsquo;ll not require to come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going downstairs she looked at the letter. It was addressed to an acting
      manager at a theatre in the farthest west of London. The passages of the
      house and the pavements outside were now empty; it was nearly two o&rsquo;clock,
      and snow was beginning to fall. She was feeling cold and a little hungry,
      but, making up her mind to deliver the letter at once, she hastened to the
      Temple station.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a <i>matinée</i>, so the acting manager was &ldquo;in front.&rdquo; He took
      the letter abruptly, opened it with an air of irritation, glanced at it,
      glanced at Glory, looked at the letter again, and then said in a strangely
      gentle voice, &ldquo;Do you know what&rsquo;s in this, my girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t&mdash;look,&rdquo; and he gave her the letter to read. It
      ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear &mdash;&mdash;: This wretched young ginger is worrying me for a
      shop. She isn&rsquo;t worth a &mdash;&mdash;. Get rid of her, and oblige
      Josephs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory flushed up to the forehead and bit her lip; then a little nervous
      laugh broke from her throat, and two great tears came rolling from her
      eyes. The acting manager took the letter out of her hands and tapped her
      kindly on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, my child. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll disappoint him yet. Tell me all about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him everything, for he had bowels of compassion. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t put
      you on at present,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but our saloon contractor wants a young lady
      to give out programmes, and if that will do to begin with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a crushing disappointment, but she was helpless. The employment was
      menial, but it would take her out of the tobacco shop and put her into the
      atmosphere of the theatre, and bring fifteen shillings a week as well. She
      might begin on Monday if she could find her black dress, white apron, cap,
      and cuffs. The dress she had already, but the apron, cap, and cuffs would
      take the larger part of the money she had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Sunday night she had swallowed her pride with one great gulp and was
      writing home to Aunt Anna:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as busy as Trap&rsquo;s wife these days; indeed, that goddess of industry
      is nothing to me now; but Christmas is coming, and I shall want to buy a
      present for grandfather (and perhaps for the aunties as well), so please
      send me a line in secret saying what he is wanting most. Snow! snow! snow!
      The snow it snoweth every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the Monday night she presented herself at the theatre and was handed
      over to another girl to be instructed in her duties. The house was one of
      the best in London, and Glory found pleasure in seeing the audience
      assemble. For the first half hour the gorgeous gowns, the beautiful faces,
      and the distinguished manners excited her and made her forget herself.
      Then little by little there came the pain of it all, and by the time the
      curtain had gone up her gorge was rising, and she crept out into the quiet
      corridor where her colleague was seated already under an electric lamp
      reading a penny number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was a little, tender black and white thing, looking like a
      dahlia. In a quarter of an hour Glory knew all about her. During the day
      she served in a shop in the Whitechapel Road. Her name was Agatha Jones&mdash;they
      called her Aggie. Her people lived in Bethnal Green, but Charlie always
      came to the theatre to take her home. Charlie was her young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the intervals between the acts Glory assisted in the cloak-room, and
      there the great ladies began to be very amusing. After the tinkle of the
      electric bell announcing the second act she returned to the deserted
      corridor, and before her audience of one gave ridiculous imitations in
      dead silence of ladies using the puff and twiddling up their front hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! It&rsquo;s you as oughter be on the styge, my dear,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on myself soon. Charlie&rsquo;s getting me on the clubs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clubs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foreign clubs in Soho. More nor one has begun there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foreigners like dancing best. If you can do the splits and shoulder
      the leg it&rsquo;s the mykings of you for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the performance was over they found Charlie waiting on the square in
      front of the house. Glory had seen him before, and she recognised him
      immediately. He was the young Cockney with the rolled fringe who had
      bantered the policeman by Palace Yard on Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day. They got into
      the Underground together, and when Glory returned to the subject of the
      foreign clubs Charlie grew animated and eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They give ye five shillings a turn, and if yer good for anythink ye may
      do six turns of a Sunday night, not ter speak of special nights, and
      friendly leads and sech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Glory got out at the Temple Aggie&rsquo;s head was resting on Charlie&rsquo;s
      shoulder, and her little gloved fingers were lightly clasped in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second night Glory had conquered a good deal of her pride. The
      grace of her humour was saving her. It was almost as if somebody else was
      doing servant&rsquo;s duty and she was looking on and laughing. After all it was
      very funny that she should be there, and what delicious thoughts it would
      bring later! Even Nell Gwynne sold oranges in the pit at first, and then
      some day when she had risen above all this&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been a great night of some sort. She had noticed red baize
      and an awning outside, and the front of one of the boxes was laden with
      flowers. When its occupants entered, the orchestra played the national
      anthem and the audience rose to their feet. It was the Prince with the
      Princess and their daughters. The audience was only less distinguished,
      and something far off and elusive moved in her memory when a lady handed
      her a check and said in a sweet voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman will come for this seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s station was in the stalls, and she did not go out when the lights
      went down and the curtain rose. The play was a modern one&mdash;the story
      of a country girl who returned home after a life of bitterness and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      It moved her and thrilled her, and stirred the smouldering fires of her
      ambition. She was sorry for the actress who played the part&mdash;the poor
      thing did not understand&mdash;and she would have given worlds to pour her
      own voice through the girl&rsquo;s mouth. Then she was conscious that she was
      making a noise with her hands, and looking down at them she saw the
      crumpled programmes and her white cuffs, and remembered where she was, and
      what, and she murmured, &ldquo;O God, do not punish me for these vain thoughts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once a light shot across her face as she stood in the darkness. The
      door of the corridor had been opened, and a gentleman was coming in. He
      stood a moment beside her with his eyes on the stage and said in a
      whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did a lady leave a seat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Drake! She felt as if she would suffocate, but answered in a
      strained voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that one. Programme, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the programme without looking at her, put his fingers into his
      waistcoat pocket, and slid something into her hand. It was sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have screamed. The humiliation was too abject. Hurrying out, she
      threw down her papers, put on her cloak and hat and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But next morning she laughed at herself, and when she took out Drake&rsquo;s
      sixpence she laughed again. With the poker and a nail she drove a hole
      through the coin and then hung it up by a string to a hook over the
      mantelpiece, and laughed (and cried a little) every time she looked at it.
      Life was so funny! Why did people bury themselves before they were dead?
      She wouldn&rsquo;t do it for worlds! But she did not go back to the theatre for
      all that, and neither did she return to the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas was near, the shops became bright and gay, and she remembered
      what beautiful presents she had meant to send home out of the money she
      had hoped to earn. On Christmas Eve the streets were thronged with little
      family groups out shopping, and there were many amusing sights. Then she
      laughed a good deal; she could not keep from laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas Day opened with a rimy, hazy morning, and the business
      thoroughfares were deserted. They had sucking pig for dinner, and Mr.
      Jupe, who was at home for the holiday, behaved like a great boy. It was
      afternoon before the postman arrived with a bag as big as a creel, and
      full of Christmas cards and parcels. There was a letter for Glory. It was
      from Aunt Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are concerned about the serious step you have taken, but trust it is
      for the best, and that you will give Mrs. Jupe every satisfaction. Don&rsquo;t
      waste your savings on us. Remember there are post-office savings banks
      everywhere, and that there is no friend like a little money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom there was a footnote from Aunt Rachel: &ldquo;Do you ever see the
      Queen in London, and the dear Prince and Princess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to service that night at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. Entering by the
      west door, a verger in a black cloak directed her to a seat in the nave.
      The great place was dark and chill and half empty. All the singing seemed
      to come from some unseen region far away, and when the preacher got into
      the curious pulpit he looked like a Jack-in-the-box, and it seemed to be a
      drum that was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming out before the end, she thought she would walk to the Whitechapel
      Road, of which Aggie had told her something. She did so, going by
      Bishopsgate Street, but turning her head away as she passed the church of
      the Brotherhood. The motley crowd of Polish Jews, Germans, and Chinamen,
      in the most interesting street in Europe, amused her for a while, and then
      she walked up Houndsditch and passed through Bishopsgate Street again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Bank she took an omnibus for home. The only other fare was a
      bouncing girl in a big hat with feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to the market, my dear? No? I hates it myself, too, so I goes to
      the &lsquo;alls instead. Come from the country, don&rsquo;t ye? Same here. Father&rsquo;s a
      farmer, but he&rsquo;s got sixteen besides me, so I won&rsquo;t be missed. Live? I
      live at Mother Nan&rsquo;s dress-house now. Nice gloves, ain&rsquo;t they? My hat?
      Glad you like the style. I generally get a new hat once a week, and as for
      gloves, if anybody likes me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night in her musty bedroom Glory wrote home while little Slyboots
      slept: &ldquo;&lsquo;The best-laid schemes o&rsquo; mice and men gang aft aglee.&rsquo; Witness
      me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intended to send you some Christmas presents, but the snow has been so
      industrious that not a mouse has stirred if he could help it. However, I
      send three big kisses instead, and a pair of mittens for grandfather&mdash;worked
      with my own hands, because I wouldn&rsquo;t allow any good Brownie to do it for
      me. Tell Aunt Rachel I <i>do</i> see the Prince and Princess sometimes. I
      saw them at the theatre the other night. Yes, the theatre! You must not be
      shocked&mdash;we are rather gay in London&mdash;we go to the theatre
      occasionally. It is so interesting to meet all the great people! You see I
      am fairly launched in fashionable society, but I love everybody just the
      same as ever, and the moment the candle is out I shall be thinking of
      Glenfaba and seeing the &lsquo;Waits,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Oiel Verree,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hunting the
      Wren,&rsquo; and grandfather smoking his pipe in the study by the light of the
      fire, and Sir Thomas Traddles, the tailless, purring and blinking at his
      feet. Merry Christmas to you, my dears! By-bye.&rdquo;

      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s that bright young Irish laidy?&rsquo; the gentlemen&rsquo;s allwiz sayin&rsquo;,
      my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jupe, and for very shame&rsquo;s sake, having no money to
      pay for board and lodgings, Glory returned to the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little beyond Bedford Row, in a rookery of apartment houses in narrow
      streets, there lives a colony of ballet girls and chorus girls who are
      employed at the lighter theatres of the Strand. They are a noisy, merry,
      reckless, harmless race, free of speech, fond of laughter, wearing false
      jewellery, false hair, and false complexions, but good boots always, which
      they do their utmost not to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these girls pass through the Turnstile on their way to their work,
      and toward seven in the evening the tobacconist&rsquo;s would be full of them.
      Nearly all smoked, as the stained forefinger of their right hands showed,
      and while they bought their cigarettes they chirruped and chirped until
      the little shop was like a tree full of linnets in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of them belonged to the Frailty Theatre, and their usual talk was of
      the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; engaged there. Chief among these were the &ldquo;Sisters Bellman,&rdquo; a
      trio of singers in burlesque, and a frequent subject of innuendo and
      rapartee was one Betty, of that ilk, whose name Glory could remember to
      have seen blazing in gold on nearly every hoarding and sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Says she was a governess in the country, my dear.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yus, I dare say.
      Came out of a slop shop in the Mile End Road though, and learned &lsquo;er steps
      with the organ man in the court a-back of the jam factory.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I
      never! She&rsquo;s a wide un, she is!&rdquo; &ldquo;About as wide as Broad Street, my dear.
      Use ter sell flowers in Piccadilly Circus till somebody spoke to &lsquo;er, and
      now she rides &lsquo;er brougham, doncher know.&rdquo; Then the laughter would be
      general, and the girls would go off with their arms about each other&rsquo;s
      waists, and singing, in the street substitute for the stage whisper, &ldquo;And
      &lsquo;er golden &lsquo;air was &lsquo;anging dahn &lsquo;er back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This yellow-haired and yellow-fingered sisterhood saw the game of life
      pretty clearly, and it did not take them long to get abreast of Glory.
      &ldquo;Like this life, my dear?&rdquo; &ldquo;Go on! Do she look as if she liked it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I do, perhaps I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell that to the marines, my dear. I use ter be in a shop myself, but I
      couldn&rsquo;t a-bear it. Give me my liberty, I say; and if a girl&rsquo;s got any
      sort o&rsquo; figure&mdash;&mdash;Unnerstand, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Late that night one of the girls came in breathless and cried: &ldquo;Hooraa!
      What d&rsquo;ye think? Betty wants a dresser, and I&rsquo;ve got the shop for ye, my
      dear. Guinea a week and the pickings; and you go tomorrow night on trial.
      By-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s old infirmity came back upon her, and she felt hot and humiliated.
      But her vanity was not so much wounded by the work that she was offered as
      her honour was hurt by the work she was doing. Mrs. Jupe&rsquo;s absences from
      home were now more frequent than ever. If the business that took her
      abroad was akin to that which had taken her to Polly Love&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To put an end to her uneasiness, Glory presented herself at the stage
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You the noo dresser, miss?&rdquo; said the doorkeeper. &ldquo;Collins has orders to
      look after you.&mdash;Collins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A scraggy, ugly, untidy woman who was passing&mdash;through an inner door
      looked back and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along of me then,&rdquo; she said, and Glory followed her, first down a
      dark passage, then through a dusty avenue between stacks of scenery, then
      across the open stage, up a flight of stairs, and into a room of moderate
      size which had no window and no ventilation and contained three cheval
      glasses, a couch, four cane-bottom chairs, three small toilet tables with
      gas jets suspended over them, three large trunks, some boxes of
      cigarettes, and a number of empty champagne bottles. Here there was
      another woman as scraggy and untidy as the first, who bobbed her head at
      Glory and then went on with her work, which was that of taking gorgeous
      dresses out of one of the trunks and laying them on the end of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me to show you her first act,&rdquo; said the woman called Collins,
      and, throwing open another of the trunks, she indicated some of the
      costumes contained in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new world to Glory, and there was something tingling and
      electrical in the atmosphere about her. There were the shouts and curses
      of the scene-shifters on the stage, the laughing voices of the chorus
      girls going by the door, and all the multitudinous noises of the theatre
      before the curtain rises. Presently there was a rustle of silk, and two
      young ladies came bouncing into the room. One was tall and pink and white,
      like a scarlet runner, the other was little and dainty. They stared at
      Glory, and she was compelled to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bellman, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye mean Betty, down&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo; said the tall lady, and at that moment Betty
      herself arrived. She was a plump person with a kind of vulgar comeliness,
      and Glory had a vague sense of having seen her before somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ye&rsquo;ve came,&rdquo; she said, and she took possession of Glory straightway.
      &ldquo;Help me off of my sealskin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory did so. The others were similarly disrobed, and in a few moments
      their three ladyships were busy before the toilet tables with their grease
      and rose-pink and black pencils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory was taking down the hair of her stout ladyship, and her stout
      ladyship was looking at Glory in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bad face, girls, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other two glanced at Glory approvingly. &ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; they answered, and
      then hummed or whistled as they went on with their making-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>thank</i> you,&rdquo; said Glory, with a low courtesy, and everybody
      laughed. It was really very amusing. Suddenly it ceased to be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nyme, my dear?&rdquo; said the little lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sort of shame at using in this company the name that was sacred to home,
      to the old parson, and to John Storm, came creeping over Glory like a
      goosing of the flesh, and by the inspiration of a sudden memory she
      answered, &ldquo;Gloria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little lady paused with the black pencil at her eyebrows, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! What a nyme for the top line of a bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! Mykes me feel like Sundays, though,&rdquo; said the tall lady with a
      shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irish, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of that sort,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brought up a laidy, I&rsquo;ll be bound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was a clergyman,&rdquo; said Glory, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden peal of laughter stopped her, whereupon she threw up her head,
      and her eyes flashed: but her stout ladyship patted her hands and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offence, Glo, but you re&rsquo;lly mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;they&rsquo;re all clergymen&rsquo;s
      daughters, doncher know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sharp knock came to the door, followed by the first call of the
      call-boy. &ldquo;Half-hour, ladies.&rdquo; Then there was much bustle and some
      irritation in the dressing-room and the tuning up of the orchestra
      outside. The knock came again. &ldquo;Curtain up, please.&rdquo; The door was thrown
      open, the three ladies swept out&mdash;the tall one in tights, the little
      one in a serpentine skirt, the plump one in some fancy costume&mdash;and
      Glory was left to gather up the fragments, to listen to the orchestra,
      which was now in full power, to think of it all and to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies returned to the dressing-room again and again in the coarse of
      the performance, and when not occupied with the changing of their dresses
      they amused themselves variously. Sometimes they smoked cigarettes,
      sometimes sent Collins for brandy and soda, sometimes talked of their
      friends in front: &lsquo;Lord Johnny&rsquo;s &lsquo;ere again. See &lsquo;im in the prompt box?
      It&rsquo;s &lsquo;is sixtieth night this piece, and there&rsquo;s only been sixty-nine of
      the run&mdash;and sometimes they discussed the audience generally: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      know what&rsquo;s a-matter with &lsquo;em to-night; ye may work yer eyes out and ye
      can&rsquo;t get a &lsquo;and.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curtain came down at length, the outdoor costumes were resumed, the
      call-boy cried &ldquo;Carriages, please,&rdquo; the ladies answered &ldquo;Right ye are,
      Tommy,&rdquo; her plump ladyship nodded to Glory, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do middling, my dear,
      when ye get yer &lsquo;and in&rdquo;; and then nothing was left but the dark stage,
      the blank house, and the &ldquo;Good-night, miss,&rdquo; of the porter at the stage
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      So these were favourites of the footlights! And Glory Quayle was dressing
      and undressing them and preparing them for the stage! Next morning, before
      rising, Glory tried to think it out. Were they so very beautiful? Glory
      stretched up in bed to look at herself in the glass, and lay down again
      with a smile. Were they so much cleverer than other people? It was
      foolishness to think of it, for they were as empty as a drum. There must
      be some explanation if a girl could only find it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second night at the theatre passed much like the first, except that
      the ladies were visited between the acts by a group of fellow-artistes
      from another company, and then the free-and-easy manners of familiar
      intercourse gave way to a style that was most circumspect and precise,
      and, after the fashion of great ladies, they talked together of morning
      calls and leaving cards and five-o&rsquo;clock tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a scene in the performance in which the three girls sang
      together, and Glory crept out to the head of the stairs to listen. When
      she returned to the dressing-room her heart was bounding, and her eyes, as
      she saw them in the glass, seemed to be leaping out of her head. It was
      ridiculous! To think of all that fame, all that fuss about voices like
      those, about singing like that, while she&mdash;if she could only get a
      hearing!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cloud had chased the sunshine from her face in a moment, and she
      was murmuring again, &ldquo;O God, do not punish a vain, presumptuous creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the same she felt happy and joyous, and on the third night she was
      down at the theatre earlier than the other dressers, and was singing to
      herself as she laid out the costumes, for her heart was beginning to be
      light. Suddenly she became aware of some one standing at the open door. It
      was an elderly man, with a bald head and an owlish face. He was the stage
      manager; his name was Sefton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, my girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a voice like that, why don&rsquo;t you
      let somebody hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her plump ladyship arrived late that night, and her companions were
      dressed and waiting when she swept into the room like a bat with
      outstretched wings, crying: &ldquo;Out o&rsquo; the wy! Betty Bellman&rsquo;s coming! She&rsquo;s
      lyte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were numerous little carpings, backbitings, and hypocrisies during
      the evening, and they reached a climax when Betty said, &ldquo;Lord Bobbie is
      coming to-night, my dear.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not if <i>I</i> know it, my love,&rdquo; said the
      tall lady. &ldquo;We are goin&rsquo; to supper at the Nell Gwynne Club, dearest.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Surprised at ye, my darling.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>You</i> are a nice one to preach, my
      pet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that encounter two of their ladyships, who were kissing and hugging
      on the stage, were no longer on speaking terms in the dressing-room, and
      as soon as might be after the curtain had fallen, the tall lady and the
      little one swept out of the place with mysterious asides about a &ldquo;friend
      being a friend,&rdquo; and &ldquo;not staying there to see nothing done shabby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she don&rsquo;t like she needn&rsquo;t, my dear,&rdquo; said the boycotted one, and then
      she dismissed Glory for the night with a message to the friend who would
      be waiting on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere of the dressing-room had become oppressive and stifling
      that night, and, notwithstanding the exaltation of her spirits since the
      stage manager had spoken to her, Glory was sick and ashamed. The fires of
      her ambition were struggling to burn under the drenching showers that had
      fallen upon her modesty, and she felt confused and compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stepped down the stairs the curtain was drawn up, the auditorium
      was a void, the stage dark, save for a single gas jet that burned at the
      prompter&rsquo;s wing, and a gentleman in evening dress was walking to and fro
      by the extinguished footlights. She was about to step up to the man when
      she recognised him, and turning on her heel she hurried away. It was Lord
      Robert Ure, and the memory that had troubled her at the first sight of
      Betty was of the woman who had ridden with Polly Love on the day of the
      Lord Mayor&rsquo;s show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling hot and foolish and afraid, she was scurrying through the dark
      passages when some one called her. It was the stage manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear your voice again, my dear. Come down at eleven in
      the morning, sharp. The leader of the orchestra will be here to play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made some confused answer of assent, and then found herself in the
      back seat, panting audibly and taking long breaths of the cold night air.
      She was dizzy and was feeling, as she had never felt before, that she
      wanted some one to lean upon. If anybody had said to her at that moment,
      &ldquo;Come out of the atmosphere of that hot-bed, my child, it is full of
      danger and the germs of death,&rdquo; she would have left everything behind her
      and followed him, whatever the cost or sacrifice. But she had no one, and
      the pain of her yearning and the misery of her shame were choking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before going home she walked over to the hospital; but no, there was still
      no letter from John Storm. There was one from Drake, many days overdue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Glory: Hearing that you call for your letters, I write to ask if you
      will not let me know where you are and how the world is using you. Since
      the day we parted in St. James&rsquo;s Park I have often spoken of you to my
      friend Miss Macquarrie, and I am angry with myself when I remember what
      remarkable talents you have, and that they are only waiting for the right
      use to be made of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours most kindly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F. H. N. Drake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks, good Late-i&rsquo;-th&rsquo;-day,&rdquo; she thought, and she was crushing the
      latter in her hand when she saw there was a postscript:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;This being the Christmas season, I have given myself the
      pleasure of sending a parcel of Yuletide goodies to your dear old
      grandfather and his sweet and simple household; but as they have doubtless
      long forgotten me, and I do not wish to embarrass them with, unnecessary
      obligations, I will ask you not to help them to the identification of its
      source.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She straightened out the letter and folded it, put it in her pocket and
      returned home. Another letter was waiting for her there. It was from the
      parson:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you sent us a Christmas-box after all! That was just like my runaway,
      all innocent acting and make-believe. What joy we had of it!&mdash;Rachel
      and myself, I mean, for we had to carry on the fiction that Aunt Anna knew
      nothing about it, she being vexed at the thought of our spendthrift
      spending so much money. Chalse brought it into the parlour while Anna was
      upstairs, and it might have been the ark going up to Jerusalem it entered
      in such solemn stillness. Oh, dear! oh, dear! The bun-loaf, and the
      almonds, and the cheese, and the turkey, and the pound of tobacco, and the
      mull of snuff! On account of Anna everything had to be conducted in great
      quietness, but it was a terrible leaky sort of silence, I fear, and there
      were hot and hissing whispers. God bless you for your thought and care of
      us! Coming so timely, it is like my dear one herself, a gift that cometh
      from the Lord; and when people ask me if I am not afraid that my
      granddaughter should be all alone in that great and wicked Babylon, I tell
      them: &lsquo;No; you don&rsquo;t know my Glory; she is all courage and nerve and
      power, a perfect bow of steel, quivering with sympathy and strength.&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Christmas had come and gone at the Brotherhood, and yet the project was
      unfulfilled. John himself had delayed its fulfilment from one trivial
      cause after another. The night was too dark or not dark enough; the moon
      shone or was not shining. His real obstacle was his superstitious fear.
      The scheme was very easy of execution, and the Father himself had made it
      so. This, and the Father&rsquo;s trust in him, had almost wrecked the
      enterprise. Only his own secret anxieties, which were interpreted to his
      consciousness by the sight of Brother Paul&rsquo;s wasting face, sufficed to
      sustain his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s dying. It can not be unpleasing to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said this to himself again and again, as one presses the pain in one&rsquo;s
      side to make sure it is still there. Under the shadow of the crisis his
      character was going to ruin. He grew cunning and hypocritical, and could
      do nothing that was not false in reality or appearance. When the Father
      passed him he would drop his head, and it was taken for contrition, and he
      was commended for humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the last day of the year, and therefore the last of his duty at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be to-night,&rdquo; he whispered, as Paul passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul nodded. Since the plan of escape had been projected he had lost all
      will of his own and become passive and inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the day lingered! And when the night came it dragged along with feet
      of lead! It seemed as if the hour of evening recreation would never end.
      Certain of the brothers who had been away on preaching missions throughout
      the country had returned for the Feast of the Circumcision, and the house
      was bright with fresh faces and cheerful voices. John thought he had never
      before heard so much laughter in the monastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the bell rang for Compline, and the brothers passed into church. It
      was a cold night, the snow was trodden hard, and the wind was rising. The
      service ended, and the brothers returned to the house with clasped hands
      and passed up to their cells in silence, leaving Brother Paul at his
      penance in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the Father put up his hood and went out to lock the gate, and the
      dog, who took this for his signal, shambled up and followed him. When he
      returned he shuddered and shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bitter night, my son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like courting death to go out in
      it. Heaven help all homeless wanderers on a night like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was wiping the snow from his slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is the last day of your penance, Brother Storm, and to-morrow
      morning you will join us in the community room. You have done well; you
      have fought a good fight and resisted the assaults of Satan. Good-night to
      you, my son, and God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a few steps forward and then stopped. &ldquo;By the way, I promised you
      the Life of Père Lacordaire, and you might come to my room and fetch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father&rsquo;s room was on the ground floor to the left of the staircase,
      and it was entered from a corridor which cut the house across the middle.
      The rooms that opened out of this corridor to the front looked on the
      courtyard, and those to the back looked across the City in the direction
      of the Thames. The Father&rsquo;s room opened to the back. It was as bare of
      ornament as any of the cells, but it had a small fire, and a writing-table
      on which a lamp was burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the room together the Father hung the key of the gate on
      one of many hooks above the bed. It was the third hook from the end
      nearest the window, and the key was an old one with very few wards. John
      watched all this, and even observed that there were books on the floor,
      and that a man might stumble if he did not walk warily. The Father picked
      up one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the book, my son. A most precious document, the very mirror of a
      living human soul. What touched me most, perhaps, were the Father&rsquo;s
      references to his mother. A monk may not have his mother to himself, and
      if the love of woman is much to him he is miserable indeed until he has
      fixed his eyes on the most blessed among women. But the religious life
      does not destroy natural affection. It only kills in order to bring forth
      new life. The corn of wheat dies that it may live again. That is the true
      Christian asceticism, my son, and so it is with our vows. Goodnight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As John was coming out of the Father&rsquo;s room, he met Brother Andrew going
      into it, with clean linen over one arm and a ewer of water in the other
      hand. He threw on his bed in the alcove the book which the Father had
      given him, and sat down on the form at the door and tried to strengthen
      himself in his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is dying for the sight of his sister. He can save her soul if he
      can only see her. It can not be displeasing to the Almighty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he lifted his head the house was silent, except for the wind that
      whistled outside its walls. Presently there was a scarcely perceptible
      click, as of a door closing, and Brother Andrew came from the direction of
      the Superior&rsquo;s room. John called to him and he stepped up on tip-toe, for
      the monk hates noise as an evil spirit. The sprawling features of the big
      fellow were all smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the Father gone to bed?&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; half an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he will be asleep by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was asleep before I left him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he doesn&rsquo;t lock his door on the inside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the Father sleep soundly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes he does, and sometimes a cat would waken him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Andrew&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you do something for me if I wanted, it very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if you had to run some risk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of that&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I got you into trouble, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t. <i>You</i> wouldn&rsquo;t get anybody into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John could go no further. The implicit trust in the simple face was too
      much for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Brother Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing at all,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I was only trying you, but
      you are too good to be tempted, and I am ashamed. You must go to bed now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I put out the lights for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not ready yet. Ugh! what a cruel wind! A cold night for Brother
      Paul in the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Brother Storm, what is the matter with Brother Paul? He makes me
      think of my mother, I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John made no answer, and the lay brother began to go upstairs. Two steps
      up he stopped and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me do something for you, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night, Brother Andrew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Brother Storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, my lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John listened to his footsteps until they stopped far overhead, and then
      all was quiet. Only the whistling of the wind broke the stillness of the
      peaceful house. He slid back the grating and looked out. All was darkness
      except for the tiny gleam of coloured light that came from the church,
      where Brother Paul sat to say his Rosary.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fortified his courage, and he got up to put out the lamps in the
      staircase and corridors. He began at the top, and as he came down he
      listened on every landing and looked carefully around. There was no sound
      anywhere except the light fall of his own deadened footstep. His
      superstitious fears came back upon him, and his restless conscience
      created terrors. The old London mansion, with its mystic cells, seemed
      full of strange shadows, and the wind howled around it like a fiend. One
      by one he extinguished the lamps. The last of them hung in the hall under
      the picture of Christ in his crown of thorns. As he put it out he thought
      the eyes looked at him, and he shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now half-past ten, and time to carry out his project. The back of
      his neck was aching and his breath was coming quick. With noiseless steps
      he walked to the door of the Father&rsquo;s room and listened again. Hearing
      nothing, he opened the door wide and stepped into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was slumbering out, but it cast a faint red glow on the ceiling
      and on the bed. A soft light rested on the Father&rsquo;s face, and he was
      sleeping peacefully. There was no sound except the wind in the chimney and
      a whistle sounding from a steamer in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reach the key, where it hung above the bed, it was necessary to step
      between the fire and the sleeping man. As John did so his black shadow
      fell on the Father&rsquo;s face. He stretched out his hand for the key and found
      that a bunch of other keys were now hanging over it. When he removed them
      they jingled slightly, and then his heart stood still, but the Father did
      not stir, and he took the key of the gate off the hook, put the other keys
      back in their place, and turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog began to howl&mdash;somebody was playing music in the street&mdash;and
      the open door made the wind to roar in the chimney. The Father sighed, and
      John stood with a quivering heart and looked over his shoulder. But it was
      only a deep human sigh uttered in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment John had returned to the corridor and closed the door
      behind him. His throat was parched, his eyelids were twitching, and his
      temples were beating like drums. He went gliding along like a thief, and
      as he passed the picture of Christ in the darkness the wind seemed to be
      crying &ldquo;Judas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back in the hall he dropped on to the form, for his knees could support
      him no longer. Love and conscience, humanity and religion clamoured loud
      in his heart and tore him in pieces. &ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;But the man&rsquo;s
      dying!&rdquo; cried another. &ldquo;Judas!&rdquo; &ldquo;She is hovering on the brink of hell and
      he may save her soul from death and damnation!&rdquo; When the struggle was
      over, conscience and religion were worsted, and he was more cunning than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the clock chimed the three quarters, and he raised his head. The
      streets, usually so quiet at that hour, were becoming noisy with traffic.
      There were the shuffling of many feet on the hard snow and the sharp crack
      of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the great door of the house with as little noise as possible and
      stepped out into the courtyard. The bloodhound started from its quarters
      and began to growl, but he silenced it with a word, and the creature came
      up and licked his hand. He crossed the court with quick and noiseless
      footsteps, lifted the latch of the sacristy and pushed through into the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a low, droning sound in the empty place. It ran a space and was
      then sucked in like the sound of the sea at the harbour steps. Brother
      Paul was sitting in the chancel with a lamp on the stall by his side. His
      head leaned forward, his eyes were closed, and the light on his thin face
      made it look pallid and lifeless. John called to him in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose quickly and followed John into the courtyard, looking wild and
      weak and lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lamp&mdash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall I go back and put
      it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How simple you are!&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Somebody may be lying awake in the
      house. Do you want him to see that you&rsquo;ve left your penance an hour too
      soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way&mdash;quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed on tip-toe to the passage leading to the street, where some
      flickering gleams of the light without fell over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your hat?&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot that too&mdash;I left it in the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take mine,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;and put up your hood and button your cassock&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a cruel night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that the time has come I&rsquo;m afraid to learn the truth about her. After
      all uncertainty is hope, you know, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! Be a man! Don&rsquo;t give way at the last moment. Here, tie my
      handkerchief about your neck! How helpless you are, though! I&rsquo;ve half a
      mind to go myself instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know what I want to say, and if you did you couldn&rsquo;t say
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then listen! Are you listening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the hospital where your sister used to be a nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask for Nurse Quayle&mdash;will you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nurse Quayle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she is on night duty she will see you at once. But if she is on day
      duty she may be in bed and asleep, and in that case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take this letter. Have you got it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to the porter. Tell him it comes from the former chaplain&mdash;you
      remember. Say it concerns a matter of great importance, and ask him to
      send it up to the dormitories immediately. Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then <i>she</i> must tell you what to do next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she is out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be-this is New Year&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait in the porch till she comes in again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s impetuous will was carrying everything before it, and the helpless
      creature began to overwhelm him with grateful blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! We&rsquo;ll not talk of that.... Have you any money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither have I. I brought nothing here except the little in my purse, and
      I gave that up on entering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any&mdash;I can walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will take you an hour then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A clock was striking somewhere. &ldquo;Hush! One, two, three ... eleven o&rsquo;clock.
      It will be midnight when you get there. Now go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The key was grating in the lock of the gate. &ldquo;Remember Lauds at six in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back at five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll open the gate at 5.30. Only six hours to do everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul was in the street, but John was in the darkness of the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely you&rsquo;ll cross London in a cab with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister went to live somewhere in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. John&rsquo;s Wood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her&rdquo;&mdash;John was striving to keep his voice firm&mdash;&ldquo;tell her
      I am happy&mdash;and cheerful&mdash;and looking strong and well, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not. You&rsquo;re too good, and you&rsquo;re wearing away in my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her I am often thinking of her, and if she has anything to say&mdash;anything
      to send&mdash;any word&mdash;any message ... it can&rsquo;t be displeasing to
      the Almighty.... But no matter! Go, go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The key had grated in the lock again, the lay brother was gone, and John
      was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God pity and forgive me!&rdquo; he muttered, and then he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traffic in the streets was increasing every moment, and as he stumbled
      across the courtyard a drunken man going by the gate stopped and cried
      into the passage, &ldquo;Helloa, there! I&rsquo;m a-watchin&rsquo; of ye!&rdquo; The bloodhound
      leaped up and barked, but John hurried into the house and clashed the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat on the form and tried to compose himself. He thought of Paul as he
      had seen him at the last moment&mdash;the captured eagle with the broken
      wing scudding into the night, the night of London, but free, free!
    </p>
    <p>
      In his mind&rsquo;s eye he followed him through the streets&mdash;down
      Bishopsgate Street into Threadneedle Street and along Cheapside to St.
      Paul&rsquo;s churchyard. Crowds of people would be there to-night waiting for
      the striking of the clock at midnight that they might raise a shout and
      wish each other a happy New Year.
    </p>
    <p>
      That made him think of Glory. She would be there too, for she loved a rich
      and abounding life. He could see her quite plainly in the midst of the
      throng with her sparkling eyes and bounding step. It would be so new to
      her, so human and so beautiful! Glory! Always Glory!
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought he must have been dreaming, for suddenly the clocks were all
      striking, first the clock in the hall, then the clocks of the churches
      round about, and finally the great clock of the cathedral. Almost at the
      same moment there was a distant sound like the rattle of musketry, and
      then the church bells began to ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noises in the street were now tumultuous. People were shouting and
      laughing. Some of them were singing. At one moment it was the Salvation
      chorus, at the next a music-hall ditty. First &ldquo;At the Cross, at the
      Cross,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Mr. &lsquo;enry &lsquo;awkins,&rdquo; and then an unfamiliar ditty. With
      measured steps over the hardened snow of the pavement there came tramping
      along a line of boys and girls, crying:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  D&rsquo;ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay?
  D&rsquo;ye ken John Peel at the break of day?
  D&rsquo;ye ken John P-e-e-l&mdash;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Their shrill trebles broke like a rocket on the topmost note, and there
      was loud laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory again! Always, always Glory!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the scales fell from his eyes and he saw himself as he was, a
      self-deluded man and a cheat. The impulses that had prompted him to this
      night&rsquo;s work had really centred in Glory. It had been Glory first and
      Glory last, and his pity for Brother Paul and his fear for the fate of
      Polly had been only a falsehood and pretence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night wind was still howling about the house. Its noise mingled with
      the peal of the church bells, and together they seemed to utter the voices
      of mocking fiends: Judas! Traitor! Fool! Fool! Traitor! Judas!
    </p>
    <p>
      He covered his ears with his hands and his head fell into his breast.

      &ldquo;The Little Turnstile,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooraa! hooraa!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feeling like bottled yeast this evening and liable to go off, I thank my
      stars I have three old babies at home to whom I am bound to tell
      everything. So lizzen, lizzen for all! Know ye then, all men (and women)
      by these presents that there is a gentleman in London who predicts
      wonderful things for Glory. His name is Sefton, and I came to know him
      through three ladies&mdash;I call them the Three Graces&mdash;whose
      acquaintance I have made by coming to live here. He is only an old
      mushroom with a bald, white head; and if I believed everything their
      ladyships say I should conclude that he is one of those who never sin
      except twice a year, and that is all the time before Christmas and all the
      time after it. But their Graces belong to that saintly sisterhood who
      would take away the devil&rsquo;s character if they needed it (they don&rsquo;t), and
      though the mushroom&rsquo;s honour were as scarce as the middle cut in salmon,
      yet in common loyalty Glory would have to believe in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all about my voice. Hearing it by accident when I was humming about
      the house like a blue-bottle, he asked me to let him hear it again in a
      place where he could judge of it to more advantage. That turned out to be
      a theatre&mdash;yes, indeed, a theatre&mdash;but it was the middle of the
      morning, and nobody was there except ourselves and a couple of cleaners,
      so Aunt Anna needn&rsquo;t be afraid. Yes, the chief of the orchestra was
      present, and he sat before a piano on the edge of the maelstrom, in what
      we should call the High Bailiff&rsquo;s pews&mdash;but they call them the stalls&mdash;while
      the mushroom himself went back to the cavernous depths of the body, which
      in a theatre they have properly christened the pit, and this morning it
      looked like the bottomless one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;-a-massey! Ever see the inside of a theatre in the daytime? Of course
      you&rsquo;ve not, my dears. It is what the world itself was the day before the
      first day&mdash;without form and void, and darkness is on the face of the
      deep. Not a ray of daylight anywhere, except the adulterated kind that
      comes mooching round corridors and prowling in at half-open doors, and
      floating through the sepulchral gloom like the sleepy eyes of the monsters
      that terrified me in the caves at Gob-ny-Deigan when I used to play
      pirate, you remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentlemen had left me alone on the stage with five or six footlights&mdash;which
      they ought to call face-lights&mdash;flashing in my eyes, and when the
      pianist began to vamp and I to sing it was like pitching my voice into a
      tunnel, and I became so dreadfully nervous that I was forced to laugh.
      That seemed to vex my unseen audience, who thought me &lsquo;rot&rsquo;; so I said,
      &lsquo;Let there be more light then.&rsquo; and there was more light, &lsquo;and let the
      piano cease from troubling,&rsquo; and it was so. Then I just stiffened my back
      and gave them one of mother&rsquo;s French songs, and after the first verse I
      called out to the manager at the back,&rdquo; Can you hear me?&rsquo; and he called
      back, &lsquo;Go on; it&rsquo;s splendid!&rsquo; So I did &lsquo;Mylecharaine&rsquo; in the Manx, and I
      suppose I acted both of my songs; but I was only beginning to be aware
      that my voice in that great place was a little less like a barrel-organ
      than usual when suddenly there came a terrific clatter, such as comes with
      the seventh wave on the shingle, and my two dear men in the dark were
      clapping the skin of their hands off!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dears! my dears! If you only knew how for weeks and weeks I had
      been moaning and lamenting that it was because I wasn&rsquo;t clever that people
      took no notice of me, you would forgive a vain creature when she said to
      herself, &lsquo;My daughter, you are really somebody, after all&mdash;you, you,
      you!&rsquo; It was a beautiful moment, though, and when the old mushroom came
      back to the stage saying: &lsquo;What a voice! What expression! What nature!&rsquo; I
      felt like falling on his bald head and kissing it, not being able to speak
      for lumps in the throat and feeling like the Methodist lady who poured out
      whisky for the class leaders after they had presented her with a watch,
      and then told the reporters to say she had suitably responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigho! I have talked about the fashionable people I meet in London, but
      I don&rsquo;t want to be one of them. They do nothing but rush about, dress,
      gossip, laugh, love, and plunge into all the delights of life. That is not
      my idea of existence. I am ambitious. I want to do something. I am tired
      in my soul of doing nothing. Yes, it <i>has</i> been that all along,
      though I didn&rsquo;t like to tell you so before. There are people who are born
      in the midst of greatness and they don&rsquo;t know how to use it. But to be one
      of the world&rsquo;s celebrities, that is so different! To have won the heart of
      the world, so that the world knows you and thinks of you and loves you!
      Say it is by your voice you do it and that your world is the concert hall,
      or even the music hall&mdash;what matter? You needn&rsquo;t <i>live</i> music
      hall, whatever the life inside of it. And then that great dark void
      peopled with faces; that laugh or cry just as you please to make them&mdash;confess;
      that it would be magnificent, my dear ones!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to go again to-night to hear what Mr. Sefton has to propose, but
      already this dingy little bedroom smiles upon me, and even the broken
      tiles in the backyard might be the pavement of paradise! If it is true
      what he tells me&mdash;-Well, he that hath the bride is the bridegroom,
      and if my doings hereafter don&rsquo;t make your hair curl I will try to show
      the inhabitants of this stupid old earth what a woman can do in spite of
      every disadvantage. I shall not be sorry to leave this place either. The
      rats in these old London houses (judging by their cries of woe) hold a
      nightly carnival for the eating up of the younger members of the family.
      And then Mrs. Jupe and Mr. Jupe&mdash;Mr. Dupe I call him&mdash;she
      deceives him so dreadfully with her gadding about&mdash;&mdash;But anon,
      anon, good people!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is New Year&rsquo;s Eve to-day, and nearly nine months since I came up to
      London. <i>Tempus fugit!</i> In fact <i>tempus</i> is <i>fugit</i>-ing
      most fearfully, considering that I am twenty-one on Sunday next, you know,
      and that I haven&rsquo;t begun to do anything really. The snowdrops must be
      making a peep at Glenfaba by this time, and Aunt Rachel will be cutting
      slips of the rose trees and putting them in pots. Yandher place must he <i>urromassy</i>
      [* Out of mercy.] nice though, with snow on the roof and the sloping lawn,
      and the windows glistening with frost&mdash;just like a girl in her
      confirmation veil as she stands hack to look at herself in the glass. I
      intend to see the New Year in this time on the outside of St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Cathedral, where people congregate in thousands as twelve o&rsquo;clock
      approaches to carry on the beautiful fiction that there is still only one
      clock in London, and they have to hold their noses in the air to watch for
      the moment when it is going to strike. But in the midst of the light and
      life of this splendid city I know my heart will go back with a tender
      twinge to the little dark streets on the edge of the sea, where the
      Methodist choirs will be singing, &lsquo;Hail, smiling morn,&rsquo; preparatory to
      coffee and currant cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will be your &lsquo;first foot&rsquo; this year, I wonder? It was John Storm last
      year, you remember, and being as dark as a gipsy, he made a perfect <i>qualtagh</i>.
      [* Manx for &ldquo;first foot.&rdquo;] And how we laughed when, disguised in the snow
      that was falling at the time, he pretended to be a beggar and came in just
      as grandfather was reading the bit about the Good Shepherd, and how he
      loved his lambs&mdash;and then I found him out! Ah me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am looking perfectly dazzling in a new hat to-day, having been going
      about hitherto in one of those little frights that used to be cocked up on
      the top of your hair like a hen on a cornstack. But now I am carrying
      about the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s feathers, and if he could only see me himself
      in them!&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what a scatter-brained creature I am! Leaving the hospital has
      made me grow so much younger every day that I am almost afraid I may come
      to contemplate short frocks. But really it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve looked
      nice for an eternity, and now I entirely retract and repent me of all I
      said about wishing to be a man. Being a girl, I&rsquo;ll put up with it, and if
      all the old mushroom says on that head also is true&mdash;&mdash; But then
      men are such funny things, bless them! Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;No word from John Storm yet. Apparently he never thinks of us
      now&mdash;of me at all events&mdash;and I suppose he has resigned himself
      and taken the vows. That&rsquo;s one kind of religion, I dare say, but I can&rsquo;t
      understand it; and I don&rsquo;t know how a dog, even, can be nailed up to a
      wall and not go mad. In the night lying in bed I sometimes think of him. A
      dark cell, a bench for a bed, a crucifix, and no other furniture, praying
      with trembling limbs and chattering teeth&mdash;No; such things are too
      high for me; I can not reach to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems impossible that <i>he</i> can be in London too. What a place
      this London is! Such a mixture! Fashion, religion, gaiety, devotion,
      pride, depravity, wealth, poverty! I find that for a girl to succeed in
      London her moral colour must be heightened a little. <i>Pinjane</i> [*
      Manx dish, like Devonshire junket] alone won&rsquo;t do. Give her a slush of <i>pissaves</i>
      [* Preserves] and she&rsquo;ll go down sweeter. Angels are not wanted here at
      all. The only angels there are in London are kept framed in the church
      windows, and I half suspect that even they were women once, and liked
      bread and butter. And then Nell Gwynne&rsquo;s flag floats from the steeple of
      St. Martin&rsquo;s in the Fields, and now and again they ring the bells for
      her!&rdquo;

      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock that night Glory was putting on her hat and cloak to
      return home when the call-boy came to the dressing-room door to say that
      the stage manager was waiting to see her. With a little catch, in her
      breath, and then with a tightening of the heart-strings, she followed him
      to the stage manager&rsquo;s office. It was a stuffy place over the porter&rsquo;s
      lodge, approached by a flight of circular iron stairs and lumbered with
      many kinds of theatrical property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, my dear,&rdquo; said the stage manager, and pushing away some models
      of scenery he made room for her on a sofa which stood by a fast-dying
      fire. Then shutting the door, he bobbed his head at her and winked with
      both eyes, and said in a familiar whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, my dear. I&rsquo;ve settled that little matter for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Glory, and then she waited with parted
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as done, my dear. Sit down.&rdquo; Glory had risen in her
      excitement. &ldquo;Sit down and I&rsquo;ll tell you everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken to his management. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;unless I&rsquo;m
      mistaken I&rsquo;ve found a prize.&rdquo; They had laughed. He was always finding
      prizes. But he knew what he was talking about, and they had given him <i>carte
      blanche</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think there is really some likelihood, then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
      Glory, with the catch in her breath again, for her throat was thick and
      her breast was heaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, now do sit down, my dear, and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was suave, he was flattering, he was intimate, he was, coaxing. She was
      to leave everything to him. Of course, there was much to be done yet. She
      had a wonderful voice; it was finer than music. She had style as well; it
      was astonishing how she had come by it. Only a dresser, too&mdash;not even
      in the chorus. But stars were never turned out by Nature. She had many
      things to learn, and would have to be coached up carefully before she
      could be brought out. He had done it for others, though, and he could do
      it for her; and if&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s eyes were shining and her heart was beating like a drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think that eventually&mdash;if I work hard&mdash;after years
      perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it on your own, my dear, so leave yourself in my hands
      entirely, and don&rsquo;t whisper a word about it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; It was like a dream coming true; she could scarcely believe in it.
      The stage manager became still more suave and flattering and familiar. If
      she &ldquo;caught on,&rdquo; there was no knowing what he might not get for her&mdash;ten
      pounds a week&mdash;fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, even fifty perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s palpitation was becoming painful, and at the bottom of her heart
      there was a certain fear of this sudden tide of fortune, as if Providence
      had somehow made a mistake and would as suddenly find it out. To appease
      her conscience she began to think of home and how happy she might make
      everybody there if God was really going to be so good to her. They should
      want for nothing; they should never know a poor day again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the stage manager was painting another picture. A girl didn&rsquo;t go
      a-begging if he once took her up. There was S&mdash;&mdash;. She was only
      an &ldquo;auricomous&rdquo; damsel, serving in a tobacconist&rsquo;s shop in the Haymarket
      when he first found her, and now where was she?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ve no interest of my own to serve, my dear&mdash;none
      whatever. And there&rsquo;ll be lots of people to tempt you away from me when
      your name is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory uttered some vehement protest, and then was lost in her dreams
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said the stage manager. He was looking at her
      with glittering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my dear, you are a very fine-looking young woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s head was down, her face was flushed, and she was turning her
      mother&rsquo;s pearl ring around her finger. He thought she was overwhelmed by
      his praises, and coming closer, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare say you&rsquo;ve got a good stage figure too, eh? Pooh! Only business, you
      know! But you mustn&rsquo;t be shy with me, my dear. And besides, if I am to do
      all this for you, you must do something for me sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hardly heard him. Her eyes were still glistening with the far-off look
      of one who gazes on a beautiful vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say, or how to thank
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he whispered, and leaning over to her he lifted her face and
      kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her poor dream of glory and grandeur and happiness was dispelled in a
      moment, and she awoke with a sense of outrage and shame. The man&rsquo;s praises
      were flattery; his predictions were a pretence; he had not really meant it
      at all, and she had been so simple as to believe everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, with the feeble, childish cry of one who has received a
      pistol wound in battle. And then she rose and turned to go. But the stage
      manager, who was laughing noisily out of his hot red face, stepped between
      her and the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, you can&rsquo;t mean&mdash;a trifle like that&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door, please,&rdquo; she said in her husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you don&rsquo;t intend&mdash;In this profession we think nothing,
      you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really&mdash;upon my word&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she came to herself again she was out in the dark back street, and
      the snow was hard and dirty under foot, and the wind was high and cold,
      and she was running along and crying like a disappointed child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bitterest part of it all was the crushing certainty that she had no
      talents and no chances of success, and that the man had only painted up
      his fancy picture as a means of deceiving her. Oh, the misery of being a
      woman! Oh, the cruelty of this great, glorious, devilish London, where a
      girl, if she was poor and alone, could live only by her looks!
    </p>
    <p>
      With God knows what lingering remnant of expectation, but feeling broken
      and beaten after her brave fight for life, and with the weak woman
      uppermost at last, she had turned toward the hospital. It was nearly
      half-past eleven when she got there, and Big Ben was chiming the half hour
      as she ascended the steps. Bracing herself up, she looked in at the
      porter&rsquo;s door with a face that was doing its best to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any letters to-night, porter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Well&mdash;none to get, none to answer, you know. Happy New Year to
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was a sob in her laughter, and the man said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be sorry to
      miss your face, nurse, but if you&rsquo;ll leave your address I&rsquo;ll send your
      letters on and save you the journey so late at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no-no, there&rsquo;ll be no more letters now, porter, and&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not
      come again. Here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She forced a shilling into the porter&rsquo;s hand in spite of his protests, and
      then fled from the look in his face which seemed to her to say that he
      would like to return her sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was lost to her. It was foolishness to go on expecting to hear
      from him. Had he not told her that the rule under which the brothers lived
      in community forbade them to write and receive letters except by special
      permission? But she had expected that something would happen&mdash;some
      accident, some miracle, she hardly knew what. That dream was over now; she
      was alone; it was no use deceiving herself any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went home by the back streets, for people were peering into her face,
      and she thought perhaps she had been crying. Late as it was, being New
      Year&rsquo;s Eve, there were groups about every corner, and in some of the
      flagged courts and alleys little girls were dancing to the music of the
      Italian organ man or turning catherine-wheels. As she was going down Long
      Acre a creachy voice saluted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening, miss! Going home early, ain&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a miserable-looking woman in clothes that might have been stolen
      from a scarecrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Market full to-night, my dear? Look as if the dodgers had been at ye.
      Live? I live off of the lane. But lor&rsquo; bless ye, I&rsquo;ve lived in a-many
      places! Seen the day I lived in Soho Square. I was on the &lsquo;alls then. Got
      a bit quisby on my top notes, you know, and took the scarlet fever&mdash;soldier,
      I mean, my dear. But what&rsquo;s the use of frettin&rsquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I likes to be jolly, and I allwiz is. Doing now? Selling flowers outside
      the theatres&mdash;police is nasty if you&rsquo;ve got nothink. Ain&rsquo;t I going
      home? Soon as I get a drain of white satin. Wish you luck, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she came up to the shop in the Turnstile she could hear that it was
      noisy with the voices of men and girls, so she turned back through
      Lincoln&rsquo;s-Inn Fields and passed down to Fleet Street. It was approaching
      twelve o&rsquo;clock by this time, and streams of people were flowing in the
      direction of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. Glory turned eastward also and allowed
      herself to be carried along with the current which babbled and talked like
      a river in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately in front of her there was a line of girls walking arm-in-arm
      across the width of the pavement. They were factory girls in big hats with
      ostrich feathers, and as they skipped along with their free step they sang
      snatches of Salvation hymns and music-hall songs. All at once they gave a
      shrill peal of laughter, and one of them cried, &ldquo;Tell me what it is and
      I&rsquo;ll give it a nyme.&rdquo; At the next moment a strange figure was forging past
      their line, going westward with long strides. It was a man in the habit of
      a monk, with long black cassock and broad-brimmed hat. Glory caught a
      glimpse of his face as he passed her. It was a hungry, eager face, with
      big, melancholy eyes, and it seemed to her that she must have seen it
      before somewhere. The wind was very cold, and the great cross on the dome
      of the cathedral stood out like a beacon against flying clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Paul&rsquo;s churchyard was thronged with noisy, happy people, and down to
      the last minute before the hour they shouted and joked and laughed. Then
      there was a hush, the great crowds seemed to hold their breath as if they
      had been a single living creature, and every face was turned upward to the
      clock. The clock struck, the bells of the cathedral began to ring, the
      people cheered and saluted each other and shook hands on every side, and
      then the dense mass broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory could have cried for joy of it all&mdash;it was so simple, so human,
      so childlike. But she listened to the laughter and salutations of the
      people about her and felt more lonely than the Bedouin in the desert; she
      remembered the bubbling hopes that had carried her through the day, and
      her heart fell low; she thought of the letter which she had posted home on
      her way to the theatre, and two great tears came rolling from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of the monk tormented her, and suddenly she bethought herself
      whose face it must have been. It must have been the face of Polly Love&rsquo;s
      brother. He belonged to the Bishopsgate Fathers, and had once been a
      patient in the hospital, and perhaps he was going there now on some errand
      or urgent message&mdash;to the doctors or to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was foolish not to leave my address when the porter asked me,&rdquo; she
      thought. She would go back and do so. There could be no harm in that; and
      if anything had really happened, if John&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy New Year to you, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somebody in the drifting crowd was standing before her and blocking the
      way. It was Agatha Jones in a mock seal-skin coat and big black hat
      surmounted by black feathers, and with Charlie Wilkes (with his diminutive
      cap pushed back from his oily fringe and pimpled forehead) leaning heavily
      on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never! Who&rsquo;d have thought of meeting you in St. Paul&rsquo;s
      churchyawd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory tried to laugh and to return the salutation over the noises of the
      people and the clangour of the bells. And then Aggie put her face close,
      as women do who are accustomed to talking in the streets, and said:
      &ldquo;Thought we&rsquo;d seen the lahst of you, my dear, when you went off that night
      sudden. Selling programmes somewhere else now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of that sort,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;ve been left the old red church this fortnight and more.
      Charlie&rsquo;s got me on the clubs. But my word!&rdquo; turning to Charlie, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s her
      as oughter be there, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;She cheeks me out,&rdquo; said Charlie, &ldquo;as you&rsquo;ll knock the stuffing out of
      Betty Bellman &lsquo;erself if you once myke a stawt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Aggie said: &ldquo;I might get you to do a turn almost any Sunday, if you
      like, my dear. There&rsquo;s always somebody as down&rsquo;t come, and they&rsquo;re glad of
      an extra turn to tyke the number if she&rsquo;s only clever enough to get a few
      &lsquo;ands. Going &lsquo;ome, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where d&rsquo;ye live?&rdquo; said Aggie, and Glory told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call for you Sunday night at eight, and if you down&rsquo;t tyke your
      chawnce when you get it, you&rsquo;re a foolisher woman than I thought you were,

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Always at half-past five in the morning the Father Superior began to
      awaken the Brotherhood. It took him a quarter of an hour to pass through
      the house on that errand, for the infirmities of his years were upon him.
      During this interval John Storm had intended to open the gate to Paul and
      then return the key to its place in the Father&rsquo;s room. The time was short,
      and to lose no part of it he had resolved to remain awake the whole night
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little need to make a call on that resolution. With fear and
      remorse he could not close his eyes, and from hour to hour he heard every
      sound of the streets. At one o&rsquo;clock, the voices singing outside were
      strained and cracked and out of tune; at two, they were brutish and
      drunken and mingled with shrieks of quarrelling; at three, there was
      silence; at four, the butchers&rsquo; wagons were rattling on the stones from
      the shambles across the river to the meat markets of London, with the
      carcasses of the thousands of beasts that were slaughtered overnight to
      feed the body of the mammoth on the morrow; and at five, the postal vans
      were galloping from the railway stations to the post-office with the
      millions of letters that were to feed its mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past five the Father had come out of his room and passed slowly
      upstairs, and John Storm was in the courtyard opening the lock of the
      outer gate. Although there was a feeling of morning in the freezing air it
      was still quite dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; he whispered, but there was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Paul!&rdquo; he whispered again, and then waited, but there was no
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not at first that he realized the tremendous gravity of what had
      occurred&mdash;that Brother Paul had not returned, and that he must go
      back to the house without him. He kept calling into the darkness until he
      remembered that the Father would be down in his room again soon and
      looking for the key where he had left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the hall, he reproached himself with his haste, and concluded to
      return to the gate. There would be time to do it; the Father was still far
      overhead; his &ldquo;Benedicamus Domino&rdquo; was passing from corridor to corridor;
      and Paul might be coming down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul! Paul!&rdquo; he cried again, and opening the gate he looked out. But
      there was no one on the pavement except a drunken man and a girl, singing
      themselves home in the dead waste of the New Year&rsquo;s morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the truth fell on him like a thundercloud, and he hurried back to the
      house for good. By this time the Father was coming down the stairs, and
      had reached the landing of the first story. Snatching up from the bed in
      the alcove the book which had been lying there all night unregarded, he
      crept into the Father&rsquo;s room. He was coming out of it when he came face to
      face with the Father himself, who was on the point of going in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been returning the book you lent me,&rdquo; he said, and then he tried
      to steal away in his shame. But the Father held him a while in playful
      remonstrance. The hours were not all saved that were stolen from the
      night, and his swelled eyes this morning were a testimony to the musty old
      maxim. Still, with a book like that, his diligence was not to be wondered
      at, and it would be interesting to hear what he thought of it. He couldn&rsquo;t
      say as yet. That wasn&rsquo;t to be wondered at either. Somebody had said that a
      great book was like a great mountain&mdash;not to be seen to the top while
      you were still too near to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s duplicity was choking him. His eyes were averted from the Father&rsquo;s
      face, for he had lost the power of looking straight at any one, and he
      could see the key of the gate still shaking from the hook on which his
      nervous fingers had placed it. When he escaped at length, the Father asked
      him to ring the bell for Lauds, as Brother Andrew, whose duty it was, had
      evidently overslept himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      John rang the bell, and then took his lamp and some tapers from a shelf in
      the hall and went out to the church to light the candles, for that also
      was Brother Andrew&rsquo;s duty. As he was crossing the courtyard on his way
      back to the house, he passed the Father going to open the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has become of your hat?&rdquo; said the Father, and then, for the
      first time, John remembered what he had done with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lent&mdash;that is to say, I&rsquo;ve lost it,&rdquo; he answered, and then
      stood with his eyes on the ground while the Father reproved him for
      heedlessness of health, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is part of the perversity of circumstance that while an incident of the
      greatest gravity is occurring, its ridiculous counterpart is usually
      taking place by the side of it. When the religious had gathered in the
      church it was seen that three of the stalls were vacant&mdash;Brother
      Paul&rsquo;s, Brother Andrew&rsquo;s, and the Father Minister&rsquo;s. The service had
      hardly begun when the bell was heard to ring again, and with a louder
      clangour than before, whereupon the religious concluded that Brother
      Andrew had awakened from his sleep, and was remembering with remorse his
      belated duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the Father Minister. That silent and severe person had
      oftentimes rebuked the lay brother for his sleepiness, and this morning he
      had himself been overcome by the same infirmity. Awakening suddenly a
      little after six by the watch that hung by his bed, he had thought, &ldquo;That
      lazy fellow is late again&mdash;I&rsquo;ll teach him a lesson.&rdquo; Leaping to his
      feet (the monk sleeps in his habit), he had hastened to the bell and rung
      it furiously, and then snatched up a taper and hurried down the stairs to
      light the candles in the church. When he appeared at the sacristy door
      with a lighted taper in his hand and confusion on his face, the brothers
      understood everything at a glance, and not even the solemnity of the
      service could smother the snufflings of their laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident was a trivial one, but it diverted attention for a time from
      the fact of Paul&rsquo;s absence, and when the religious went back to the house
      and found Brother Andrew returned to his old duty as doorkeeper, the
      laughter was renewed, and there was some playful banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk is so far a child that the least thing happening in the morning
      is enough to determine the temper of the day, and as late as the hour for
      breakfast the house was still rippling with the humour of the Father
      Minister&rsquo;s misadventure. There was one seat vacant in the refectory&mdash;Brother
      Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;and the Superior was the first to observe it. With a twinkle
      in his eye, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like Boy Blue this morning. Two of my stray sheep have come home,
      bringing their tails behind them. Will anybody go in search of the third?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm rose immediately, but a lay brother was before him, so he sat
      down again with his white cheeks and quivering lips, and made an effort to
      eat his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader for the week recited the Scripture for the day, and then took
      up the book which the brothers were hearing at their meals. It was the
      Life and Death of Father Ignatius of St. Paul, and the chapter they had
      come to dealt with certain amusing examples of vanities and foibles. An
      evil spirit might have selected it with special reference to the incidents
      of the morning, for at every fresh illustration the Father Minister
      squirmed on his seat, and the brothers looked across at him and laughed
      with a spice of mischief, and even a touch of malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s eyes were on the door, and his heart was quivering, but the
      messenger did not return during breakfast, and when it was over the
      Superior rose without waiting for him and led the way to the community
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fire was burning in the wide grate, and the room was cheerful with
      reflected sun-rays, for the sun was shining in the courtyard and
      glistening on the frosty boughs of the sycamore. It was a beautiful New
      Year&rsquo;s morning, and the Father began to tell some timely stories. In the
      midst of the laughter that greeted them the lay brother returned and
      delivered his message. Brother Paul could not be found, and there was not
      a sign of him anywhere in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said the religious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is in his cell,&rdquo; said the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is not there,&rdquo; said the messenger, &ldquo;and his bed has not been slept
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that explains something,&rdquo; said the Father. &ldquo;I thought he didn&rsquo;t
      answer when I knocked at his door in the morning, but my ears grow dull
      and my eyes are failing me, and I told myself perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange&rsquo;&rdquo; said the religious, with looks of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps he staid all night at his penance in the church,&rdquo; said the
      Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently his hat did so at all events,&rdquo; said one of the brothers. &ldquo;I
      saw it lying with his lamp on the stall in front of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, and then the Father said with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my children are so amusing in such matters! Only this morning I had
      to reprove Brother Storm for losing his hat somewhere, and now Brother
      Paul&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By an involuntary impulse, obscure to themselves, the brothers turned
      toward John, who was standing in the recess of one of the windows with his
      pale face looking out on the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; said the Superior, and they passed out of the room
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father led the way to his room and closed the door behind them. But
      there was little need for confession; the Father seemed to know everything
      in an instant. He sat in his wicker chair before the fire and rocked
      himself and moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, God&rsquo;s wrath comes up against the children of disobedience,
      but we must do our best to bear our punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm made no excuses. He had stood by the Father&rsquo;s chair and told
      his story simply, without fear or remorse, only concealing that part of it
      which concerned himself in relation to Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the Father, &ldquo;I see quite plainly how it has been. He was
      like tinder, ready to take fire at a spark, and you were thinking I had
      been hard and cruel and in-human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the truth; John could not deny it; he held down his head and was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But shall I tell you why I refused that poor boy&rsquo;s petition? Shall I tell
      you who he was, and how he came to be here? Yes, I will tell you. Nobody
      in this house has heard it until now, because it was his secret and mine
      and God&rsquo;s alone&mdash;not given me in confession, no, or it would have to
      be locked in my breast forever. But you have thrust yourself in between
      us, so you must hear everything, and may the Lord pity and forgive you and
      help you to bear your burden!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John felt that a cold damp was breaking out on his forehead, but he
      clinched his moist hands and made ready to control himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he ever spoken of another sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has sometimes mentioned her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps you have been told of the painful and tragic event that
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said John, but something that he had heard at the board meeting at
      the hospital returned at that moment with a stunning force to his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father, poor man, was one of my own people&mdash;one of the lay
      associates of our society in the world outside. But his health gave way,
      his business failed him, and he died in a madhouse, leaving his three
      children to the care of a friend. The friend was thought to be a worthy,
      and even a pious man, but he was a scoundrel and a traitor. The younger
      sister&mdash;the one you know&mdash;he committed to an orphanage; the
      elder one he deceived and ruined. As a sequel to his sin, she lived a life
      of shame on the streets of London, and died by suicide at the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm put up one hand to his head as if his brain was bursting, and
      with the other hand he held on to the Father&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was bad enough, but there was worse to follow. Our poor Paul had
      grown to be a man by this time, and Satan put it into his heart to avenge
      his sister&rsquo;s dishonour. &lsquo;As the whirlwind passeth, so the wicked are no
      more.&rsquo; The betrayer of his trust was found dead in his room, slain by an
      unknown assassin. Brother Paul had killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had fallen to his knees. If hell itself had opened at his feet
      he could not have been stricken with more horror. In a voice strangled by
      fear he stammered: &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this before? Why have you
      hidden it until now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passions, my son, are the same in a monastery as outside of it, and I had
      too much reason to fear that the saintliest soul in our Brotherhood would
      have refused to live and eat and sleep in the same house with a murderer.
      But the poor soul had come to me like a hunted beast, and who was I that I
      should turn my back upon him? Before that he had tramped through the
      streets and slept in the parks, under the impression that the police were
      pursuing him, and thereby he had contracted the lung disease from which he
      suffers still. What was I to do? Give him up to the law? Who shall tell me
      how I could have held the balance level? I took him into my house; I
      sheltered him; I made him a member of our community; Heaven forgive me, I
      suffered myself to receive his vows. It was for me to comfort his stricken
      body, for the Church to heal his wounded soul; and as for his crime, that
      was in God&rsquo;s hands, and God alone could deal with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father had risen to his feet, and he spoke the last words with
      uplifted hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you know why I refused that poor boy&rsquo;s petition. I loved him as a
      son, but neither the disease of his body nor the weakness of his mind
      could break the firmness of the rule by which I held him. I knew that
      Satan was dragging him away from me, and I would not give him up to the
      sufferings and dangers which the Evil One was preparing for him in the
      world. But how subtle are the temptations of the devil! He found the weak
      place in my armour at last. He found you, my son&mdash;you; and he tempted
      you by all your love, by all your pity, by all your tenderness, and you
      fell, and this is the consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father clasped his hands at his breast and walked to and fro in the
      little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bitterness of the world against religious houses is great already;
      but if anything should happen now, if a crime should be committed, if our
      poor brother, clad in the habit of our Order&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and crossed himself and lifted His eyes, and said in a
      tremulous whisper: &ldquo;O God, whom have I in heaven but thee? My flesh and my
      heart faileth; but God is the strength of my heart and my portion
      forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John had staggered to his feet like a drunken man. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;send me away from you. I am not fit to live by your side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father laid both hands on his shoulders. &ldquo;And shall I lower my flag to
      the enemy like that? There is only one way to defeat the devil, and that
      is to defy him. No, no, my son, you shall remain with me to the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Punish me, then. Give me penance. Let me be the lowest of the low and the
      meanest of the mean. Only tell me what I am to do and I will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to the door and resume your duty as doorkeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John looked at the Father with an expression of bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had done with it, my son, but Heaven knew better. And
      promise that when you are there you will pray for our wandering brother,
      that he may not be allowed to fulfil the errand on which you sent him out;
      pray that he may never find his sister, or anybody who knows her and can
      tell him where she is and what has become of her; pray that she may never
      cross his path to the last hour of life and the first of death&rsquo;s
      sundering; promise to pray for this, my son, night and day, morning and
      evening, with all your soul and strength, as you would pray for God&rsquo;s
      mercy and your soul&rsquo;s salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John did not answer; he was like a man in a stupor. &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Are you sending me back to the door? Can you trust me again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father stepped to the side of the bed and took the key of the gate
      from its place under the shelf. &ldquo;Take this key with you, too, because for
      the future you are to be the keeper of the gate as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John had taken the key mechanically, hardly hearing what was being said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, then&mdash;have you got faith in me still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father put both hands on his shoulders again and looked into his face.
      &ldquo;God has faith in you, my child, and who am I that I should despair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When John Storm returned to the door his mind was in a state of
      stupefaction. Many hours passed during which he was only partly conscious
      of what was taking place about him. Sometimes he was aware that certain of
      the brothers had gathered around, with a tingling, electrical atmosphere
      among them, and that they were asking questions about the escape, and
      whispering together as if it had been something courageous and almost
      commendable, and had set their hearts beating. Again, sometimes he was
      aware that big Brother Andrew was sitting by his side on the form,
      stroking his arm from time to time, and talking in his low voice and
      aimless way about his mother and the last he saw of her. &ldquo;She followed me
      down the street crying,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I have often thought of it since
      and been tempted to run away.&rdquo; Also he was aware that the dog was with him
      always, licking the backs of his stiff hands and poking up a cold snout
      into his downcast face.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time he was doing his duties automatically and apparently without
      help from his consciousness, opening and closing the door as the brothers
      passed in and out on their errands to the dead and dying, and saying,
      &ldquo;Praise be to God!&rdquo; when a stranger knocked. It may be that his body was
      merely answering to the habits of its intellect, and that his soul, which
      had sustained a terrible blow, was lying stunned and swooning within.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it revived and he began to know and to feel once more, there was no
      one with him, for the brothers were asleep in their beds and the dog was
      in the courtyard, and the house was very quiet, for it was the middle of
      the night. And then it came back to him, like a dream remembered in the
      morning, that the Father had asked him to pray for Brother Paul that he
      might fail in the errand on which he had sent him out into the world, and
      though with his lips he had not promised, yet in his heart he had
      undertaken to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      And being quite alone now, with no one but God for company, he went down
      on his knees in his place by the door and clasped his hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God,&rdquo; he prayed, &ldquo;have pity on Paul, and on me, and on all of us! Keep
      him from all danger and suffering and from the snares and assaults of the
      Evil One! Grant that he may never find his sister&mdash;or anybody who
      knows her&mdash;or anybody who can tell him where she is and what has
      become of her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But having got so far he could get no farther, for suddenly it occurred to
      him that this was a prayer which concerned Glory and himself as well. It
      was only then that he realized the magnitude and awfulness of the task he
      had undertaken. He had undertaken to ask God that Paul might not find
      Glory either, and therefore that he on his part might never hear of her
      again. When he put it to himself like that, the sweat started from his
      forehead and he was transfixed with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his knees and sat on the form, and for a long hour he
      laboured in the thought of a thousand possibilities, telling himself of
      the many things which might befall a beautiful girl in a cruel and wicked
      city. But then again he thought of Paul and of his former crime and
      present temptation, and remembered the shadow that hung over the
      Brotherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God, help me,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;strengthen me, support me, guide me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to frame another prayer, but the words would not come; he tried
      to kneel as before, but his knees would not bend. How could he pray that
      Glory also might be lost&mdash;that something might have happened to her&mdash;that
      somewhere and in some way unknown to him&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, a thousand times no! The prayer was impossible. Let come what
      would, let the danger to Paul and to the Brotherhood be what it might, let
      Satan and all his legions fall on him, yet he could not and would not
      utter it.

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The stars were paling, but the day had not yet dawned, when there came a
      knock at the door. John started and listened. After an interval the knock
      was repeated. It was a timid, hesitating tap, as if made with the tips of
      the fingers low down on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praise be to God!&rdquo; said John, and he drew the slide of the grating. He
      had expected to see a face outside, but there was nothing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he asked, and there came no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the lamp that was kept burning in the hall and looked out
      through the bars. There was nothing in the darkness but an icy mist, which
      appeared to be rising from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only another of my dreams,&rdquo; he thought, and he laid his hand on the slide
      to close it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard a sigh that seemed to rise out of the ground, and at the
      same moment the dog uttered a deep bay. He laid hold of the door and
      pulled it quickly open. At his feet the figure of a man was kneeling, bent
      double and huddled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul!&rdquo; he cried in an excited whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Paul raised his head. His face was frightfully changed. It was
      gray and wasted. His eyes wandered, his lips trembled, and he looked like
      a man who had been flogged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, what a wreck!&rdquo; thought John. He helped him to rise and enter.
      The poor creature&rsquo;s limbs were stiff with cold, and he stumbled from
      weakness as he crossed the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, thank God, you are back and no harm done!&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;How anxious
      we&rsquo;ve been! You must never go out again&mdash;never! There, brother, sit
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wandering eyes looked up with a supplicating expression. &ldquo;Forgive me.
      Brother Storm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John would not listen. &ldquo;Hush, brother! what have I to forgive? How
      cold you are! Your hands are like ice. What can I do? There&rsquo;s no fire in
      the house at this time of night&mdash;even in the kitchen it will be out
      now. But wait, I can rub you with my hands. See, I&rsquo;m warm and strong.
      There&rsquo;s a deal of blood in me yet. That&rsquo;s better, isn&rsquo;t it? Tingling, eh?
      That&rsquo;s right&mdash;that&rsquo;s good! Now for your feet&mdash;your feet will be
      colder still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, brother, no. I ought to be kissing the feet of everybody in the house
      and asking the prayers of the community, and yet you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! what nonsense! Let me take off this shoe. Dear me, how it sticks!
      Why, you&rsquo;ve worn it through and through. Look! What a mercy the snow was
      hard! If there had been thaw, now! How far you must have walked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve wandered a long way, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall tell me all about it. I want to hear everything&mdash;every
      single thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to tell. I&rsquo;ve failed in my errand&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John, who was on his knees, drew back and looked up. &ldquo;Do you mean, then&mdash;-Have
      you not seen your sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s gone, and nobody knows anything about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s for the best, brother. God&rsquo;s will be done, you know.
      If you had found her&mdash;who knows?&mdash;you might have been tempted&mdash;But
      tell me everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can not do that, I&rsquo;m so weak, and it&rsquo;s not worth while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to hear all that happened. See, your feet are all right now&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      rubbed them warm again. Though I fast so much and look so thin I&rsquo;ve a deal
      of life in me. And I&rsquo;ve been pouring it all into you, haven&rsquo;t I? That&rsquo;s
      because I want you to revive and be strong and tell me everything. Hush!
      Speak low; don&rsquo;t waken anybody! Did you find the hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Nurse Quayle sees nothing of your sister now? That&rsquo;s the pity of the
      life she is leading, poor girl! No friends, no future&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo; that, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nurse was not there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed, and then John said in another voice: &ldquo;I suppose she
      was on a holiday. It was very stupid of me; I didn&rsquo;t think of that. Twice
      a year a hospital nurse is entitled to a week&rsquo;s holiday, and no doubt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she was gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? You mean left the hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; in a husky voice, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t to be wondered at either. A
      high-spirited girl finds it hard to be bound down to rule and regulation.
      But the porter&mdash;he is an intelligent man&mdash;he would tell you
      where she had gone to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked him; he didn&rsquo;t know. All he could say was that she left the
      hospital on the morning of Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be the 9th of November&mdash;the day we took our vows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause; the big dark eyes were wandering vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, he is only a porter; you asked for the matron, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I thought she might know what had become of my sister. But she
      didn&rsquo;t. As for Nurse Quayle, she had been dismissed also, and nobody knew
      anything about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John had seated himself at Paul&rsquo;s side and the form itself was quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s just like her,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;That matron was always a
      hard woman. And to think that in that great house of love and pity nobody&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m forgetting something, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The porter told me that the nurse called for her letters from time to
      time. She had been there that night&mdash;not half an hour before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you followed her, didn&rsquo;t you? You asked which, way she had gone, and
      you hurried after her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but half an hour in London is a week anywhere else. Let anybody
      cross the street and she is lost&mdash;more lost to sight than a ship in a
      storm on the ocean. And then it was New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and the thoroughfares
      were crowded, and thousands of women were coming and going&mdash;and&mdash;what
      could I do?&rdquo; he said helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      John answered scornfully: &ldquo;What could you do? Do you ask me what you could
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have tramped every street in London and looked into the face of
      every woman I met until I had found her. I should have worn my shoes to
      the welt and my skin to the bone before I should have come crawling home
      like a snail with my shell broken over my head!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard on me, brother, least of all now, when I have come home
      like a snail, as you say, with my shell broken. I was very tired and ill
      and did all I could. If I had been strong like you and brave-hearted I
      might have struggled longer. Bid I <i>did</i> tramp the streets and look
      into the women&rsquo;s faces. She must have been among them, if she&rsquo;s living the
      life you speak of; but God would not let me find her. Why was it that my
      search was fruitless? Perhaps there was evil in my heart at first&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t mind telling you that now&mdash;but I swear to you by Him who died
      for us that at last I only wanted to find my sister that I might save her.
      But I am such a helpless creature, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John put his arm about Paul&rsquo;s shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, brother. I was mad to talk to you like that&mdash;I who sent
      you out on that cruel night and staid at home myself. You did what you
      could&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that&mdash;really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, only at the moment it seemed as if we had changed places somehow,
      and it was I who had lost a sister and been out to find her, and given up
      the search too soon, and come home empty and useless and broken-spirited,
      and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul was looking up at him with a face full of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think I did all I could to find her&mdash;the nurse, I
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John had turned his own face away, and there was no answer. Paul tried
      to say something, but he could not find the words. At last in a choked
      voice he murmured: &ldquo;We must keep close together, brother; we are in the
      same boat now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And feeling for John&rsquo;s hand, he took it and held it, and they sat for some
      minutes with bowed heads, as if a ghost were going by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing but prayer and penance and fasting left to us, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still John made no reply, and the broken creature began to comfort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have peace here at all events, and you wouldn&rsquo;t, think what
      temptations come to you in the world when you&rsquo;ve lost somebody, and there
      seems to be nothing left to live for. Shall I tell you what I did? It was
      in the early morning and I was standing in a doorway in Piccadilly. The
      cabs and the crowds were gone, and only the nightmen were there swilling
      up the dirt of the pavements with their hose-pipes and water. &lsquo;My poor
      girl is lost,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;We shall never see one another again. This
      wicked city has ruined her, and our mother, who was so holy, was fond of
      her when she was a little child.&rsquo; And then my heart seemed to freeze up
      within me... and I did it. You&rsquo;ll think I was mad&mdash;I went to the
      police station and told them I had committed a crime. Yes, indeed, I
      accused myself of murder, and began to give particulars. It was only when
      they noticed my habit that I remembered the Father, and then I refused to
      answer any more questions. They put me in a cell, and that was where I
      spent the night, and next morning I denied everything, and they let me
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, dropping his voice to a hoarse whisper, he said: &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what
      brought me back, though. It was the vow. You can&rsquo;t think what a thing the
      vow is until you&rsquo;ve broken it. It&rsquo;s like a hot iron searing your very
      soul, and if you were dying and at the farthest ends of the earth, and you
      had to crawl on your hands and knees, you would come back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have said more, but an attack of coughing silenced him, and when
      it was over there was a sound of some one moving in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Father,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Our voices have wakened him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul struggled to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a life of penance and suffering you&rsquo;ve come back to, my poor
      lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;nothing at all&mdash;But are you sure you think I
      did everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did what you could. Are you going somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to the Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, my lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And God bless you too, brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, by the order of the Superior, John Storm, with the
      help of Brother Andrew and the Father Minister, carried Brother Paul to
      his cell. The bell had been rung for Lauds, and going up the stairs they
      passed the brothers coming down to service. News of Paul&rsquo;s return had gone
      through the house like a cutting wind, and certain of the brothers who had
      gathered in groups on the landings were whispering together, as if the
      coming back had been a shameful thing which cast discredit on all of them.
      It wasn&rsquo;t love of rule that had brought the man home again, but broken
      health and the want of a bed to die upon! Thus they talked under their
      breath, unconscious of the secret operation of their own hearts. In a
      monastery, as elsewhere, failure is the worst disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm returned to the hall with a firm step and eyes full of
      resolution. Hardly answering the brothers, who plied him with questions,
      he pushed through them with long strides, and, taking the key of the outer
      gate from the place in the alcove where he had left it, he turned toward
      the Father&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had dawned, and through the darkness which was lifting in the
      little room he could see the Father rising from his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; he cried in an excited voice, and his words, like his breath,
      came in gusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this key back again. The world is calling me, and I can not trust
      myself at the door any longer. Put me under the rule of silence and
      solitude, and shut me up in a cell, or I shall break my obedience and run
      away as sure as heaven is over us!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Glory awoke on New Year&rsquo;s morning with a little hard lump at her heart,
      and thought: &ldquo;How foolish! Am I to give up all my cherished dreams because
      one man is a scoundrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The struggle might be bitter, but she would not give in. London was the
      mother of genius. If she destroyed she created also. It was only the weak
      and the worthless she cast away. The strong she made stronger, the great
      she made greater. &ldquo;O God, give me the life I love!&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;give me
      a chance; only let me begin&mdash;no matter how, no matter where!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remembered her impulse of the night before to follow Brother Paul, and
      the little hard lump at her heart grew bitter. John Storm had gone from
      her, forgotten her, left her to take care of herself. Very well, so be it!
      What was the use of thinking? &ldquo;I hate to be sentimental,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Aggie called on Sunday night she would go with her, no matter if it was
      beginning at the bottom. Others had begun there, and what right had she to
      expect to begin anywhere else? For the future she would take the world on
      its own terms and force it to give way. She would conquer this great cruel
      London, and yet remain a good girl in spite of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the mood in which she came down to breakfast, and the first thing
      that met her eyes was a letter from home. At that her face burned for a
      moment and her breath came in gusts, but she put the letter into her
      pocket unopened and tossed her head a little and laughed. &ldquo;I hate to be so
      sensitive,&rdquo; she thought, and then she began to tell Mrs. Jupe what she
      intended to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clubs!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Jupe. &ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t tyke to the shop
      because you fancied yerself above present company. But the foreign clubs!
      My gracious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hissing of Mrs. Jupe&rsquo;s taunting voice followed her about all that day,
      and late at night, when they were going to bed and the streets were quiet,
      and there was only the jingle of a passing hansom or a drunken shout or
      the screech of a concertina, she could hear it again from the other side
      of the plaster partition, interrupted occasionally by the sound of Mr.
      Jupe&rsquo;s attempts to excuse and apologize for her. No matter! Anything to
      escape from the atmosphere of that woman&rsquo;s house, to be free of her and
      quit of her forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward eight o&rsquo;clock on Sunday evening she went up to her bedroom to put
      on her hat and ulster, and being alone there, and waiting for Aggie, she
      could not help but open her letter from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunday next is your birthday, my dear one,&rdquo; wrote the parson, &ldquo;so we send
      you our love and greetings. This being the first of your twenty-one that
      you have spent from home, I will be thinking of you all the day through,
      and when night comes, and I smoke a pipe by the study fire, I know I shall
      be leaving the blind up that I may see the evening star and remember the
      happy birthdays long ago, when somebody, who was so petted and spoiled,
      used to say she had just come down from it, having dressed herself in some
      strange and grand disguises, and told us she was Phonodoree the fairy. You
      will be better employed than that, Glory, and as long as my dear one is
      well and happy and prosperous in the great city where she so loves to be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The candle was shaking in Glory&rsquo;s hands, and the little half-lit bedroom
      seemed to be blinking in and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Anna had added a postscript: &ldquo;Glad to hear you are enjoying yourself
      in London, but rather alarmed at your frequent mention of theatres. Take
      care you don&rsquo;t go too often, child, and mind you send us the name of the
      vicar of the parish you are living in, for I certainly think grandfather
      ought to write to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this again there was a footnote by Aunt Rachel: &ldquo;You say nothing of Mr.
      Drake nowadays. Is he one of Mrs. Jupe&rsquo;s visitors? And is it he who takes
      you to theatres?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a New Year&rsquo;s card enclosed, having a picture of an Eastern
      shepherd at the head of his flock of sheep and bearing the inscription,
      &ldquo;Follow in his footsteps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the hissing sound of Mrs. Jupe&rsquo;s voice came up from below, and Glory&rsquo;s
      tears were dried in an instant. On going downstairs, she found Aggie in
      her mock sealskin and big black feathers sitting in the parlour at the
      back of the shop, and Mrs. Jupe talking to her in whispers, with an
      appearance of knowledge and familiarity. She caught the confused look of
      the one and the stealthy glances of the other, and the hard lump at her
      heart grew harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Glory, and a few minutes afterward the girls were walking
      toward Soho. The little chapels in the quieter streets were dropping out
      their driblets of people and the lights in the church windows were being
      extinguished one by one. Aggie had recovered her composure, and was
      talking of Charlie as she skipped along with a rapid step, swinging her
      stage-box by her side. Charlie was certain to be at one of the clubs, and
      he would be sure to see them home. He wasn&rsquo;t out of his time yet, and that
      was why her father wouldn&rsquo;t allow him about. But he was in an office at a
      foundry, and his people lived in a house, and perhaps one of these days&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say that some of the people who are on the stage now began at the
      clubs?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty, my dear. There&rsquo;s Betty Bellman for one. She was at a club in Old
      Compton Street when Mr. Sefton found her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie had to &ldquo;work a turn&rdquo; at each of three clubs that night, and the
      girls were now at the door of the first of them. It stood at the corner of
      a reputable square, and was like any ordinary house on the outside. But
      people were coming and going constantly, and the doorkeeper was kept
      opening and closing the door. In the middle of the hall a clerk stood at a
      desk, having a great book in front of him, and making a show of
      challenging everybody as he entered. He recognised Aggie as an artiste,
      but passed Glory also on the payment of twopence and the signing of her
      name in the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dining-room of the house had been converted into a bar, with counter
      and stillage, and after the girls had crushed through the crowds that
      stood there they came into a large and shabby chamber, which had the
      appearance of having been built over the space which had once been the
      backyard. This room had neither windows nor skylights; its walls were
      decorated with portraits of Garibaldi and Victor Emanuel in faded colours,
      and there was a stage and proscenium at its farther end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an Italian club that met there on Sunday nights, and some two or
      three hundred hairdressers and restaurant-keepers of swarthy complexion
      sat in groups at little round tables with their wives and sweethearts
      (chiefly English women), smoking and drinking and laughing at the
      performance on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie went down to her dressing-room under the floor, and Glory sat at a
      table with a yellow-haired lady and a dark-eyed man. A negro without the
      burnt cork was twanging a banjo and cracking the jokes of the corner-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my style&mdash;a merry touch-and-go,&rdquo; said the lady. And then
      glancing at Glory, &ldquo;Singing to-night, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thort you might be a pro&rsquo; p&rsquo;rhaps. Use ter be myself when I was in the
      bally at the Lane. Married now, my dear; but I likes to come of a Sunday
      night when the kids is got to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Aggie danced a skirt dance, and there were shouts of applause for
      her, and she came back and danced again. When she reappeared in jacket and
      hat, and with her stage-box in her hand, the girls crushed their way out.
      Going through the bar they were invited to drink by several of the men who
      were standing there, but they got into the streets at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re rather messy, those bars,&rdquo; said Aggie; &ldquo;but managers like you to
      come round and tyke something after you&rsquo;ve done your turn&mdash;if it&rsquo;s
      only a cup of cawfy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like this life?&rdquo; said Glory, taking a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, awfully!&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their next visit was to a Swiss club, which did not greatly differ from
      the Italian one, except that the hall was more shabby, and that the
      audience consisted of French and Swiss waiters and skittish young English
      milliners. The girls had taken their hats and cloaks off and sat dressed
      like dolls in white muslin with long streamers of bright ribbon. A
      gentleman sang the &ldquo;Postman&rsquo;s Knock,&rdquo; with the character accompaniment of
      a pot hat and a black-edged envelope, a lady sang &ldquo;Maud&rdquo; in silk tights
      and a cloak, Aggie danced her skirt dance, and then the floor was cleared
      for a ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to dance the Swiss dance,&rdquo; said Aggie, &ldquo;and the M. C. wants
      me to tyke a place; but I hate these fellows to be hugging me. Will you be
      my partner, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;just for a minute or two,&rdquo; said Glory, with nervous gaiety.
      And then the dance began.
    </p>
    <p>
      It proved to be a musical version of odd man out, and Glory soon found
      herself being snapped up by other partners and addressed familiarly by the
      waiters and their women. She could feel the moisture of their hands and
      smell the oil of their hair, and a feeling like a spasm of physical pain
      came over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s getting lyte,&rdquo; said Aggie, and they crushed through the crowded
      bar and out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twanging of the fiddles, the thud of the dancing, and the peals of
      coarse laughter followed them from the stifling atmosphere within, and
      Glory felt sick and faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say that managers of good places call at these clubs sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often,&rdquo; said Aggie, and she hummed a music-hall tune as she skipped and
      tripped along.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets, which had been dark and quiet when they arrived in Soho, were
      now ablaze with lights in every window, and noisy with people on every
      pavement. The last club they had to visit was a German one, and as they
      came near it they saw that a man was standing at the door bareheaded and
      looking out for somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Charlie,&rdquo; said Aggie with a little jump of joy. But when they came
      up to him a scowl darkened his dark face, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lyte as usyal! Two of the bloomin&rsquo; turns not come, and me looking up and
      dahn the bloomin&rsquo; street for you every minute and more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s eyes blinked as if he had struck her, but she only tossed her
      head and stiffened her under lip, and said: &ldquo;Jawing again, are ye? I&rsquo;d
      chuck it for once, Charlie, if it was only for sake of company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that she disappeared to the dressing-room, and Charlie took charge of
      Glory, crushed a way for her through the refreshment room, offered her a
      &ldquo;glaws of somethink,&rdquo; and with an obvious pride of possession introduced
      her to admiring acquaintances as &ldquo;a friend o&rsquo; mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Like yer style,
      Charlie,&rdquo; said one of them. &ldquo;Oh, yus! Dare say!&rdquo; said Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proscenium was surmounted by the German and English flags intertwined,
      the walls were adorned with oleograph portraits of the Kaiser, his father
      and grandfather, Bismarck and Von Moltke, and the audience consisted
      largely of lively young German Jews and Jewesses in evening dress, some
      Polish Jews, and a sprinkling of other foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Aggie&rsquo;s turn Glory was conscious that two strangers out of another
      world altogether had entered the club and were standing at the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toffs,&rdquo; said Charlie, looking at them over her shoulder, and then,
      answering to himself the meaning of their looks, &ldquo;No, my luds! &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the
      first we&rsquo;ve seen of sech!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Aggie came up with an oily person in a flowered waistcoat and said,
      &ldquo;This is my friend, guv&rsquo;nor, and she wouldn&rsquo;t mind doing a turn if you
      asked her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If de miss vill oblige,&rdquo; began the oily one, and then the blood rushed to
      Glory&rsquo;s face, and before she knew what else had happened, her hat and
      ulster were in Aggie&rsquo;s hands and she was walking up the steps to the
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some applause when she went on, but she was in a dazed condition
      and it all seemed to be taking place a hundred miles away. She heard her
      own voice saying, &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, with your kind permission I will
      endeavour to give you an imitation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and something more. Down
      to that moment her breath had been coming and going in hot gasps, and she
      had felt a dryness in her throat; but every symptom of nervousness
      suddenly disappeared, and she threw up her head like a charger in battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she sang. It was only a common street song, and everybody had heard
      it a thousand times. She sang &ldquo;And her golden hair was hanging down her
      back&rdquo; after the manner of a line of factory girls going home from work at
      night. Arm-in-arm, decked in their Vandyke hats, slashed with red ribbons
      and crowned with ostrich feathers, with their free step, their shrill
      voices&mdash;they were there before everybody&rsquo;s eyes, everybody could see
      them, everybody could recognise them, and before the end of the first
      verse there were shouts and squeals of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory felt dizzy yet self-possessed; she gave a little audible laugh while
      she stood bowing between the verses. In a few minutes the song was
      finished and the people were stamping, whistling, uttering screeching
      cat-calls, and shouting &ldquo;Brayvo!&rdquo; But Glory was sitting at the foot of the
      stage by this time with a face contorted as in physical pain. After the
      first thrill of success the shame of it all came over her and she saw how
      low she had fallen, and felt horrified and afraid. The clamour, the
      clapping of hands, the vulgar faces, the vulgar laughter, the vulgar song,
      Sunday night, her own birthday! It all passed before her like the
      incidents in some nightmare, and at the back of it came other memories&mdash;Glenfaba,
      the sweet and simple household, the old parson smoking by the study fire
      and looking up at the evening star, and then John Storm and the church
      chimes at Bishopsgate! One moment she sat there with her burning face,
      staring helplessly before her, while people crowded round to shake hands
      with her and cried into her ears above the deafening tumult, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
      to tyke another turn, dear&rdquo;; and then she burst into passionate weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand avay! De lady&rsquo;s not fit to sing again,&rdquo; said some one, and she
      opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the two gentlemen who had been standing at the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach Gott! Is it you? Don&rsquo;t you know me, nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Koenig, the organist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious! Vot are you doing here, my child? Two monts ago I haf ask
      for you at de hospital, and haf write to de matron, but you vere gone.
      Since den I haf look for you all over London. Vhere do you lif?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory told him, and he wrote down the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! A genius, and lif in a tobacco shop! My vife vill call on you and
      fetch you avay. She is a goot woman, and vhatever she tell you to do you
      must do it; but not musical and clever same like as you. Bless mine soul!
      Singing in a Sunday club! Do you know, my child, you haf a voice, and
      talents, great talents! Vants training&mdash;yes. But vhat vould you haf?
      Here am I, Carl Koenig! I speak ver&rsquo; bad de Englisch, but I know ver&rsquo; goot
      to teach music. I vill teach you same like I teach oder ladies who pay me
      many dollare. Do you know vhat I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she knew what he was&mdash;he was the organist at All Saints&rsquo;,
      Belgravia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! I am a composer as veil. I write songs, and all your countrymen and
      countryvomen sing dem. I haf a choral company, too, and it is for dat I
      vant you. I go to de first houses in de land, de lords, de ministers, de
      princes. You shall come vith me. Your voice is soprano&mdash;no,
      mezzo-soprano&mdash;and it vill grow. I vill pitch it, and vhen it is
      ready I vill bring you out. But now get away from dis place and naivare
      come back, or I vill be more angry as before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Glory rose, and he led her to the door. Her heart felt big and her
      eyes were glistening. Aggie was in the refreshment-room. Having finished
      for the night, the girl had resumed her outdoor costume without removing
      her make-up, and was laughing merrily among a group of men and playing
      them off against Charlie, who was still in the sulks and drinking at the
      bar. When Glory appeared, Aggie fidgeted with her glove and said, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
      you going to see us home, Charlie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere as you can come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie&rsquo;s eyes watered, and she wrenched a button off, but she only laughed
      and answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think as we&rsquo;re throwing ourselves at <i>your</i>
      head, my man! We only wanted to <i>know</i>. Ta-ta!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now midnight, and the streets were thin of people, but sounds of
      music and dancing came from nearly every open window and door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie was crying. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of the clubs,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they lead
      &lsquo;em to the gambling hells. And then a young man always knows when he can
      tyke advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they returned past the Swiss club somebody who was being thrown out
      into the street was shouting in a gurgling voice, &ldquo;Let go o&rsquo; my throat or
      I&rsquo;ll corpse ye!&rdquo; And farther on two or three girls in their teens, with
      their arms about the necks of twice as many men, were reeling along the
      pavement and singing in a tuneless wail.

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Toward the middle of Lent the Society of the Holy Gethsemane was visited
      by its ecclesiastical Visitor. This was the Bishop of the diocese, a
      liberal-minded man and not a very rigid ecclesiastic, abrupt, brusque,
      businesslike, and a good administrator. When the brothers had gathered in
      the community room, he took from the Superior the leathern-bound volume
      containing the rule of the Brotherhood and read aloud the text of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether I approve of your rule or not is a
      matter with which we have no concern at present. My sole duty is to see
      that it is lawfully administered. Are you satisfied with the
      administration of it and willing to remain under its control?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was only one response from the brothers&mdash;they were entirely
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop rose with a smile and bowed to the brothers, and they began to
      leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two of my people whom you have not yet seen,&rdquo; said the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In their cells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in their cells?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them is ill; the other is under the rule of silence and solitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us visit them,&rdquo; said the Bishop, and they began to ascend the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not agree with your theory of the religious life, Father, but when
      I see your people giving up the world and its comforts, its joys and
      possessions, its ties of blood and affection&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the topmost story, and the Father had paused to recover
      breath. &ldquo;This cell to the right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is occupied by a lay brother
      who was tempted by the Evil One to a grievous act of disobedience, and the
      wrath of God has fallen on him. But Satan has overreached himself for
      once, and by that very act grace has triumphed. Not a member of our
      community rejoices more in the blessed sacrament, and when I place the
      body of our Lord&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May we go in to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; he is dying of lung disease, but you shall see with what
      patience he possesses his soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother Paul was sitting before a small fire in an arm-chair padded with
      pillows, holding in his dried-up hands a heavy crucifix which was
      suspended from his heck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lightsome and cosy we are up here!&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;A long way up,
      certainly, but no doubt you get everything you require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say the brothers are very good to you&mdash;they usually are so to
      the weak and ailing in a monastery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too good, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you see a doctor occasionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three times a week, and if he would only let me escape from an evil and
      troublesome world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! It&rsquo;s not right to talk like that, my son. Whatever happens, it is
      our duty to live, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost all there was to live for, and besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is nothing you wish for?&rdquo; said the Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but death,&rdquo; said Paul, and lifting the crucifix he carried it to
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God we are born to die!&rdquo; said the Bishop, and they stepped back to
      the corridor and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This next cell,&rdquo; said the Father, &ldquo;is occupied by such a one as you were
      thinking of&mdash;one who was born to possess the world and to achieve its
      sounding triumphs, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he given it up entirely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite young, and he has left the world, not as Augustine did, after
      learning by bitter experience the deceitfulness of sin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why is he here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can not trust himself yet. He feels the inward strivings and struggles
      of our rebellious nature and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then his solitude and silence are voluntary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now they are. See,&rdquo; said the Father, and stooping to the floor he picked
      up a key that lay at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He locks himself in and pushes the key under the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they entered the cell John Storm was standing by the window in a
      stream of morning sunlight, looking out on the world below with fixed and
      yearning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is our Visitor,&rdquo; said the Father. &ldquo;The rule of silence is relaxed in
      his case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not seen you before?&rdquo; said the Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, Father,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, and where did you live before you came here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have both seen and heard you. But I perceive that the world has
      gone on a little since you left it&mdash;your canon is an archdeacon now,
      and one of the chaplains to the Queen as well. How long have you been in
      the Brotherhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the 14th of August.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long have you kept your cell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the octave of Epiphany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is Lent&mdash;rather a long penance, Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often urged our dear brother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You carry your fastings and prayers too far, Mr. Storm,&rdquo; said the Bishop.
      He was picking up one by one some black-letter books that were lying on
      the table and on the bed. &ldquo;I know that divines in all ages tell us that
      the body is evil, and that its desires and appetites must be eradicated.
      But they also teach us that the perfect Christian character is the
      blending of the two lives, the life of Nature and the life of grace. Don&rsquo;t
      despise your humanity, my son. Your Master did not despise it. He came
      down from heaven that he might live and work among the sinful brotherhood
      of man. And don&rsquo;t pray for death, or fast as if you wished for it. You
      would have no right to do that even if you were like your poor neighbour
      next door, whom Death smiles on and beckons to repose. But you are young
      and you are strong. Who knows what good work your heavenly Father keeps
      waiting for you yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John had returned to the window and was looking out with vacant eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this is beside my present business,&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;There is
      nothing you wish to complain of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are content to live in this house, under the laws and statutes of
      this society and in voluntary obedience to its Superior?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop was leaving the cell, when his eye was arrested by some writing
      in pencil on the wall. It ran, &ldquo;9th of November&mdash;Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;;
      and under it were short lines such as a prisoner makes when he keeps a
      reckoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this date?&rdquo; said the Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was silent, but the Father answered with a smile: &ldquo;That is the date
      of his vow, my lord. It is part of the discipline of his life of grace to
      keep count of the days of his novitiate, so eager is he for the time when
      he may dedicate his whole life to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back at the head of the stairs the Father paused again and said, &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound as of a trembling hand turning the key in the lock of
      the door they had shut behind them, and at the next moment the key itself
      came out of the aperture under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door closed on the Bishop and John Storm was alone in his cell,
      one idea was left with him&mdash;the idea of work. He had tried everything
      else, and everything had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had tried solitude. On asking to be shut up in a cell, he had said to
      himself: &ldquo;The thought of Glory is a temptation of my unquickened and
      unspiritual nature. It has already betrayed me into an act of cowardice
      and inhumanity, and it will drive me out into the world and fling me back
      again, as it drove out and flung back Brother Paul.&rdquo; But the result of his
      solitude was specious and deceitful. As pictures seem to float before the
      eyes after the eyelids are closed, so his past life, now that it was over,
      seemed to rise up before him with awful distinctness. Sitting alone in his
      cell, every event of his life with Glory passed before him in review, and
      harassed him with pitiless condemnation. Why had he failed to realize the
      essential difference of temperament between himself and that joyous
      creature? Why had he hesitated to gratify her natural and innocent love of
      mere life? Why had he done this? Why had he not done that? If Glory were
      lost, if the wicked and merciless world had betrayed her, the fault was
      his, and God would surely punish him. Thus did solitude enervate his soul
      by frightening it, and the temptation he had hoped to vanquish became the
      more strong and tyrannical.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had tried reading. The Fathers told him that God allowed ascetics to
      keep the keys of their nature in their own hands; that they had only to
      think of woman as more bitter than death, and of her beauty as a cause of
      perdition, and that if any woman&rsquo;s face tormented them they were to
      picture it to the eye of the mind as old and wrinkled, defaced by disease,
      and even the prey of the worm. He tried to think of Glory as the Fathers
      directed, but when darkness fell and he lay on his bed, with the first
      dream of the night the strong powers of Nature that had no mind to
      surrender swept down the pitiful bulwarks of religion, and Glory was
      smiling upon him in her youth, her beauty, her sweetness, her humour, and
      all the grace of her countless gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had tried fasting. Three times a day Brother Andrew brought him his
      food, and twice a day, when the lay brother had left him, he opened the
      window and spread the food on the sill for the birds to take. But the
      results of his fasting were the reverse of his expectations. At one moment
      he was uplifted by strong emotions, at the next moment he was in collapse.
      Visions began to pass before him. His father&rsquo;s face tormented him
      constantly, and sometimes he was conscious of the face of his mother,
      though he had never known her. But above all and through all there came
      the face of Glory. Fasting had only extended his dreams about her. He was
      dreaming both by day and by night now, and Glory was with him always.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had tried prayer. Hitherto he had said his Offices regularly, but now
      he would say special prayers as well. To get the victory over his lawless
      and rebellious nature he would turn his eyes to the mother of the Lord.
      But when he tried to fix his mind on Mary there was nothing to answer to
      it. All was shadowy and impalpable. There was only a vague, empty cloud
      before his eyes, until suddenly a luminous face glided into the vacant
      place, and it was full of tenderness, of sweetness, of charm, of pity and
      womanly love&mdash;but it was the face of Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despair laid hold of him. His attempts to overcome Nature were clearly
      rejected by the Almighty. Winter passed with its foggy days. The Father
      wished him to return to the ordinary life of the community, yet he begged
      to be allowed to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the spring came and diffused its joy throughout all Nature. He
      listened to the leaves, he watched the birds threading their way in the
      clear air, he caught glimpses of the yellow flowers, and strained his eyes
      for the green country beyond. The young birds began to take wing, and one
      little sparrow came hopping into his room as often as he opened his window
      in the morning and played about his feet like a mouse, and then was gone
      to the mother bird that called to it from the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little hope grew to impatience, and impatience rose to fever
      heat; but he remembered his vow, and, to put himself out of temptation, he
      locked the door of his cell and pushed the key through the aperture under
      it. But he could not lock the door of his soul, and his old trouble came
      up again with the throb of a stronger and fresher life. Every morning when
      he awoke he thought of Glory. Where was she now? What had become of her by
      this time? He wrote on the wall the date of her disappearance from the
      hospital&mdash;&ldquo;9th of November; Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;&mdash;and tried to keep
      pace in his mind with the chances of her fate. &ldquo;I am guilty of a folly,&rdquo;
       he thought. The pride of his reason revolted against what he was doing.
      Nevertheless, he knew full well it would be the same to-morrow, and the
      next day, and the next year, for his human passions would not yield, and
      his vow still clutched him as with fangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing one morning by the window looking through an opening
      between high buildings to the river, with its hay barges gliding down the
      glistening water-way, and its little steamers with their spirals of smoke
      ascending, when everything in the world began in a moment to bear another
      moral interpretation. The lesson of life was work. Man could not exist
      without it. If he departed from that condition, no matter how much he
      fasted and meditated and prayed, he was useless and miserable and
      depraved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lock turned in the door of his cell and the Father and the Bishop
      entered. When they were gone he felt suffocated by their praises of his
      piety, and asked himself, &ldquo;What am I doing here?&rdquo; He was a hypocrite. Ten
      thousand other men whom the Church called saints had been hypocrites
      before him, and as they paced their cloisters they had asked themselves
      the same question. But the mighty hand of the Church was over him still,
      and with trembling fingers he turned the key again and pushed it under the
      door. Then he knew that he was a coward also, and that religion had
      deprived him of his will, of his manhood, and enervated his soul itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Paul was moving about in the adjoining cell. The lay brother had
      become very weak; his step was slow, his feet dragged along the floor; his
      breath was audible and sometimes his cough was long and raucous. John had
      heard these sounds every day and had tried not to listen, but now he
      strained his ears to hear. A new thought had come to him: he would ask to
      be allowed to nurse Brother Paul; that should be his work, for work alone
      could save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he leaped up from sleep at the first syllable of &ldquo;Benedicamus
      Domino,&rdquo; and cried, &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; But when the door opened in answer to his
      call it was the Father Minister who entered. The Superior had gone to give
      a Retreat to a sisterhood in York, and would be absent until the end of
      Lent. John looked at the hard face of the deputy, the very mirror of its
      closed and frozen soul, and he could say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it anything that I can do for you?&rdquo; said the Father Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;that is to say&mdash;no, no,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he opened his window that day he could hear the Lenten services in
      the church. The prayers, the responses, the psalms, and the hymns woke to
      fresh life the memory of things long past, and for the first time he
      became oppressed with a great loneliness. The near neighbourhood of
      Brother Paul intensified that loneliness, and at length he asked for an
      indulgence and spoke to the Father Minister again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Paul is ill; let me attend to him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father Minister shook his head. &ldquo;The brother gets all he wants. He
      does not wish for constant attendance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is a dying man, and somebody should be with him always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor says nothing can be done for him. He may live months. But if
      he is dying, let us leave him to meditate on the happiness and glory of
      another world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John made no further struggle. Another door had closed on him. But it was
      not necessary to go to Brother Paul that he might be with him always. The
      spiritual eye could see everything. Listening to the sounds in the
      adjoining cell, it was the same at length as if the wall between them had
      fallen down and the two rooms were one. Whatever Brother Paul did John
      seemed to see, whatever he said in his hours of pain John seemed to hear,
      and when he lifted his scuttle of coal from the place at the door where
      the lay brother left it, John&rsquo;s hand seemed to bear up the weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a poor, pathetic folly, but it brought the comfort of company, and
      John thought with a pang of the time when he had wished to be separated
      from Paul, and had all but asked for a cell elsewhere. Paul had a fire,
      and John could hear him build and light and stir it; and sometimes when
      this was done he could sit down himself before his own empty grate on his
      own side of the wall and fancy they were good comrades sitting side by
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day passed he thought that Brother Paul on his part also was
      touched by the same sense of company. His silence at certain moments, his
      half-articulate salutations, his repetition of the sounds that John
      himself made, seemed to be the dumb expression of a sense that, in spite
      of the wall that divided them, and the rule of silence and solitude that
      separated them on John&rsquo;s side, they were, nevertheless, together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Paul&rsquo;s cough grew rapidly worse, and at last it burst into a fit
      so long and violent as to seem as if it would never end. John held his
      breath and listened. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll suffocate,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll never live
      through it!&rdquo; But the spasm passed, and there was a prolonged hush, a dead
      stillness, that was not broken by so much as the sound of a breath. Was he
      gone? By a sudden impulse, in the agony of his suspense, John stretched
      out his hand and knocked three times on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence, and then faintly, slowly, and irregularly three
      other knocks came back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul had understood, and John shouted in his joy. But even on top of his
      relief came his religious fears. Had he broken the rule of silence? Were
      they guilty of a sin?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, for many days thereafter, though they knew it was a fault,
      in this vague and dumb and feeble fashion they communicated constantly. On
      going to bed they rapped &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo;: on rising for the day they rapped
      &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo; They rapped when the bell rang for midday service, and
      again when the singing came up through the courtyard. And sometimes they
      rapped from sympathy and sometimes from pity, and sometimes from mere
      human loneliness and the love of company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did these exiles from life, struggling to live under the eye of God
      in obedience to their earthly vow, try to cheer their crushed and fettered
      souls, and to comfort each other like imprisoned children.

    <h2>
      XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Priory, St. John&rsquo;s Wood, London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold, all men and women at Glenfaba, I have made one further change in
      my rôle of female Wandering Jew! You have to think of Glory now, dear
      people, in a nice house in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, though there is no wood
      anywhere visible except the park, where they keep all the wild beasts in
      London&mdash;all that go on four legs, you know. The master of the mansion
      is Mr. Carl Koenig, a dear old hippopotamus who is five-feet-nothing in
      his boots, and has piercing black eyes and an electroplated mustache. He
      is a sort of an English-German-Dutch-Polish musician. When he talks of
      himself as an organist he is always a little John Bull, being F. R. C. O.
      and lots of things besides; when he speaks of &lsquo;Vaterland&rsquo; he is a German;
      when he mentions the sea he is a Dutchman; and when he is in good spirits
      (or they are in him) he sings &lsquo;Poland is not lost forever!&rsquo; all over the
      house until you sometimes wish it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife is an Englishwoman, about forty or more, with big, moist, doggy
      eyes that give you an idea of slave-humility, and an unappreciated and
      undeveloped soul. There never were two married folk less alike, she being
      one of those silent creatures who come into a room and sit and listen and
      never speak, except to give instructions to the maids, while he is always
      cackling like an old hen who can never lay an egg without letting the
      whole world know all about it. They have two female servants&mdash;both
      beautiful Cockneys&mdash;besides a boy in the garden, and a parrot that
      holds forth all over the place; and their house is the rendezvous of all
      kinds and conditions of great people, for Mr. Koenig himself is a sort of
      Gideon&rsquo;s lamp among &lsquo;pros&rsquo; of nearly every order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you want to know how I come to be here. You are to learn then
      that Mr. Koenig happened to be one of my patients in the hospital, he
      having gone there for a slight operation, and I having helped to nurse him
      through what he calls his &lsquo;operatic cure.&rsquo; In the course of that ordeal he
      had music of a less excruciating kind sometimes, it seems, and after his
      return home he searched for me all over London on account of my voice, and
      finding me unexpectedly at last he sent his wife to Mrs. Jupe&rsquo;s to fetch
      me, and&mdash;and here I am in a dainty little dimity room, whose walls
      are covered with portraits of well-known singers, violinists, pianists,
      and composers, with their affectionate inscriptions underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you want to learn why I am here. Well, you must know that Mr. Koenig
      (although a foreign musician) is organist of All Saints&rsquo;, Belgravia, where
      they sing a solo anthem at nearly every Sunday morning service; and having
      had various disappointments at the hands of vocal soloists from the Opera,
      whose &lsquo;professional engagements suddenly intervened,&rsquo; he conceived the
      audacious idea of &lsquo;intervening&rsquo; a woman to do their duty permanently. So
      this is my position in the church at which John Storm used to be curate,
      and once a week I pipe that his old enemy the canon may play. But as that
      good man is of St. Paul&rsquo;s opinion about women holding their tongues in the
      synagogue, and is blest with just enough ear to know a contralto from a
      corn-crake, I have to be hidden away behind a screen in order that his
      reverence may have all the fun to himself of believing me to be a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see, my dearies, you needn&rsquo;t be anxious about me, &lsquo;at all at all&rsquo;,
      seeing that I am living in this atmosphere of art and the odour of
      sanctity, and that I have kept only one tiny little thing back, and I am
      going to tell you that now. You were afraid that I might go too often to
      the theatre, Aunt Anna. Never mind, auntie, I shall not be going so very
      often now, and in proof thereof permit me to introduce myself in my future
      style and character&mdash;Miss Glory Quayle, the eminent social
      entertainer! You don&rsquo;t know what that is, dear people? It is quite simple
      and innocent, nevertheless. I am to go to the houses of smart people when
      they give their grand parties and sing and recite, and so forth. Nothing
      wrong, you see&mdash;only what I used to do at Glenfaba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know that, just as in the country the men go to the smithy when
      they have nothing more pressing on hand than to settle the affairs of the
      universe, and the women to the mangle-house when they have to mangle other
      things besides clothes, so in the towns the poor rich people have their
      own particular diversion, which they call their &lsquo;At Homes.&rsquo; Mr. Drake used
      to tell me they were terrible Tower-of-Babel concerns, at which everybody
      talked at once, and all the tongues in the place went &lsquo;click-clack, world
      without end.&rsquo; But they must be perfectly charming for all that; and when I
      think of the dresses and the diamonds and the titles as long as your
      breath&mdash;oh, dear! oh, dear!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see it all soon, I suppose, for to supply the place of the hammer
      and the anvil the smart folks always add musical accompaniment to the
      confusion of tongues, and Mr. Koenig, who has a choral company, goes to
      the cream of the cream of such gatherings, and sings and plays from Grieg
      and Schumann, and Liszt and Wagner, and Chopin and Paderewski, and the
      place intended for me in this grand organization would appear to be that
      of jester to my lords and ladies. &lsquo;<i>Ach Gott!</i>&rsquo; says Mr. Koenig, who
      &lsquo;speaks ver&rsquo; bad de Englisch,&rsquo; &lsquo;your great people vant de last new ting.
      One lady she say to me, &ldquo;Dear Mr. Koenig, I tink I shall not ask you dis
      season. I hear you everyvheres I go to, and I get so tired of peoples.&rdquo;
       But vhen I takes anoder wis me I am a new beesness. You shall sing and
      recite your leetle funny tings. Your great people tink dey loof music, but
      dey loof better to laugh. &ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake make dem laugh, Mr. Koenig&rdquo;&mdash;dat&rsquo;s
      vhat a great man say to me. But, my gootness, how can I? I am a musician,
      I am a composer, I am an arteeste!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For this high and noble office I have been going through a purgatory of
      preparation in which I have sometimes hardly known whether I was a
      hurdy-gurdy or an explosion of cats, and the future female jester has even
      been known to lie down on the floor and cry in her dumps of despair or
      some such devilry. However, Mr. Koenig begins to believe that I am
      passable, and my first appearance is to be made immediately after Lent, at
      the house of the Home Secretary, where it is not improbable, dear Aunt
      Rachel, that I may meet Mr. Drake, although that is no part of my
      programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I shall have to look charming in any case, and I am already
      busy with my dress. It is a black silk gown with a tight-fitting bodice.
      The bodice has windbag sleeves, formed of shawl pieces of guipure lace,
      and some lilies of the valley on the breast, finished with a waistband of
      heliotrope velvet, and I am going to wear long black gloves all the way up
      my arms, which are growing round and plump, and lovely enough for
      anything. The skirt is my old one, and I got the lace for three-and-six,
      so I am not ruining myself, you see; and though my hair is getting redder
      than ever, red is the fashionable colour in London now, therefore I
      sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t waste much money on dyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for all this brave exterior, when the time comes I know that down in
      my heart I shall be terrified. It will be like the first dive of the year.
      &lsquo;One plunge, Glory, my child,&rsquo; and then over I&rsquo;ll go! I partly realize
      already what it will be like by my experiences on Sunday evenings when the
      celebrities come here after church, and Mr. Koenig exhibits me to admiring
      friends and tells them how I brought him &lsquo;goot look,&rsquo; and I overhear them
      say, &lsquo;That girl will show them all something yet.&rsquo; Oh, this London is
      adorable, my dears, with its wit and fashion, and gaiety and luxury! and I
      have concluded that to live in the world is the best thing one can do,
      after all. Some people say hard things about it, and want to reform it, or
      even to leave it altogether; but I love it! I love it! and think it just
      charming!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now spring is here, and the world is lovely in its yellow and green.
      It must be <i>urromassy</i> nice over yandher in the &lsquo;oilan&rsquo; too, with the
      primroses and the violets and the gorse in the glen. Oh, dear! oh, dear! I
      can smell it all three hundred miles away! The lilacs will be out at
      Glenfaba now, and Aunt Anna will be collecting her Easter eggs. Well&mdash;wait
      a whilley, and I&rsquo;ll come to thee, my dears!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word from John Storm, of course. No doubt he is fighting with
      shadows while other people are struggling with realities. They tell me
      these Brotherhoods are common in the Church now, though most of them are
      secret societies; but the more I think of that kind of religion the more
      it looks like setting tasks to try faith, as if God were a coquettish
      woman. That reminds me that Mr. Worldly-Wealthy-Wiseman is no longer a
      canon, having got himself made archdeacon, and as such he looks more than
      ever like a black Spanish cock, being clad, of course, in those funny
      clothes, like the bishops, which always make one think their lordships
      must be in doubt on getting up in the morning whether they ought to wear a
      schoolboy&rsquo;s knickerbockers or a ballet-girl&rsquo;s skirt, so they settle the
      difficulty by putting on both. For this reason I try to avoid him when on
      duty at the church, lest I should be suddenly possessed of a devil and
      behave badly to his face. But this being Lent, and there being special
      preachers every day, it chanced on Sunday morning that I came upon three
      of him all in a row, and oh, my gracious, Solomon in all his glory was not
      arrayed like one of these!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too bad, though, to think that men like John Storm can&rsquo;t find room
      in the Church for the sole of their foot, while this archdemon is
      flourishing in it like a green bay tree. Forgive me, grandfather; I can&rsquo;t
      help it. But then the Church in the country doesn&rsquo;t seem the same as in
      town. <i>There</i> you are somehow made to feel that man does a little and
      God does all the rest, while <i>here</i> we reverse that order of things,
      with the result that this seed of the Amalekite&mdash;but never mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the Zoo this morning. There was a lion shut up in a cage all by
      himself. Such a solemn, splendid, silent fellow; I could have cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is the witching hour of night, my daughter, and you must put
      yourself to bed. &lsquo;Goot look!&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night of Good Friday, John Storm was wakened by
      noises in the adjoining cell. There seemed to be the voices of two men in
      angry and violent altercation, the one threatening and denouncing, the
      other protesting and supplicating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl is dead&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that proof enough?&rdquo; said one voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      lie! It&rsquo;s a false accusation!&rdquo; said the other voice. &ldquo;Paul, what are you
      going to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Put this bullet in your brain.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m innocent&mdash;I
      take the Almighty to witness that I&rsquo;m innocent. Put the pistol down. Help!
      help!&rdquo; &ldquo;No use calling&mdash;there&rsquo;s nobody in the house.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mercy! mercy!
      I haven&rsquo;t much money about me, but you shall have it all. Take everything&mdash;everything&mdash;and
      if there&rsquo;s anything I can do to start you in life&mdash;I&rsquo;m rich, Paul&mdash;I
      have influence&mdash;only spare me!&rdquo; &ldquo;Scoundrel, do you think you can buy
      me as you bought my sister?&rdquo; &ldquo;And if I did I was not the only one.&rdquo; &ldquo;Liar!
      Tell that to herself when you meet her at the judgment!&rdquo; &ldquo;As-sassin!&rdquo; &ldquo;Too
      late&mdash;you&rsquo;ve met her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm listened and understood. The two voices were one voice, which
      was the voice of Brother Paul. The lay brother was delirious. His poor
      broken brain was rambling in the ways of the past. He was re-enacting the
      scene of his crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      John hesitated. His impulse was to fly into Paul&rsquo;s room and lay hold of
      him, that he might prevent him from doing himself any injury. But he
      remembered the law of the community, that no member of it should go into
      the cell of another under pain of grievous penance. And then there was the
      rule of silence and solitude which had not yet been lifted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But monks are great sophists, and at the next moment John Storm had told
      himself that it was not Brother Paul who was in the adjoining room, but
      only his poor perishing body, labouring through the last sloughs of the
      twilight land of death. Paul himself, his soul, his spirit, was far away.
      Hence it could be no sin to go into the cell of one whose senses were not
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own door was locked, but he scraped back the key and lit his candle,
      and stepped into the passage. The voices were still loud in Paul&rsquo;s room,
      but no one seemed to hear them. Not another sound broke the silence of the
      sleeping house. The cell beyond Paul&rsquo;s was empty. It was Brother Andrew&rsquo;s
      cell, and Andrew was at the door downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Storm entered the dark room, candle in hand, Brother Paul was
      standing in the middle of the floor with one hand outstretched and a
      ghastly and appalling smile upon his face. He was pale as death, his eyes
      were ablaze, his forehead was streaming with perspiration, and he was
      breathing from the depths of his chest. He wiped the dews from his brow
      and said in a choking voice, &ldquo;He has died as he lived&mdash;a liar and a
      scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John took him by the hand and drew him to the bed, and, putting him to sit
      there, he tried to soothe and comfort him. He was terrified at first by
      the sound of his own voice, but the sophism that had served to bring him,
      served to support him also, and he told himself it could be no breach of
      the rule of silence to speak to one who was not there. The delirium of the
      lay brother spent itself at length, and he fell into a deep sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, when Brother Andrew came to John&rsquo;s cell with the food, he began
      to sing as if to himself while he bustled about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Paul is sinking&mdash;he is sinking rapidly&mdash;Father Jerrold
      has confessed him&mdash;he has taken the sacrament&mdash;and is very
      patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, as if it had been a Gregorian chant, the great fellow had hit upon
      as a means of communicating with John without breaking the rule and
      committing sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      John did not lock his door on the following night. On going to bed he
      listened for the noises he had heard before, half fearing and yet half
      wishing that he might hear them again. But he heard nothing, and toward
      midnight he fell asleep. Something made him shudder, and he awoke with the
      sensation of moonlight on his face. The moon was indeed shining, and its
      sepulchral light was on a figure that stood by the foot of the bed. It was
      Paul, with a livid face, murmuring his name in a voice almost as faint as
      a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      John leaped up and put his arms about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ill, brother&mdash;very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; cried John, and he made for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, brother, hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care for rule. Rule is nothing in a case like this. And,
      besides, it is an understood thing&mdash;&mdash; Help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore you, I conjure you!&rdquo; said Paul in a voice strangled by
      weakness. &ldquo;Let them leave us together a little longer. It was by my own
      wish that I was left alone. I have something to say to you&mdash;something
      to confess. I have to ask your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In two strides John had reached the door, but he came back without opening
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my poor lad, what have you done to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you let me out of the house to go in search of my sister&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was long ago; we&rsquo;ll not talk of it now, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can not die in peace without telling you. You remember that I had
      something to say to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a threat. I was going to tell her that unless she gave up her way
      of life I should find the man who had been the cause of it and follow him
      up and kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only a temptation of the devil, brother, and it is past; and now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what I was going to do? I was going to bring trouble and
      disgrace upon you also as my comrade and accomplice. That&rsquo;s what a man
      comes to when Satan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But God willed it otherwise, brother; let us say no more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forgive me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive? It is I who ought to ask for your forgiveness, and perhaps if I
      told you everything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something else. Listen! The Almighty is calling me; I have no
      time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are so cold, brother! Lie on the bed, and I&rsquo;ll cover you with the
      bedclothes. Oh, never fear; they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t separate us again. If the Father
      were at home&mdash;he is so good and tender-hearted&mdash;but no matter.
      There, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will despise and hate me&mdash;you who are so holy and brave, and
      have given up everything and conquered the world, and even triumphed over
      love itself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, isn&rsquo;t it? Everybody knows what a holy life you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have never lived the religious life at all, and I only came to it
      as a refuge from the law and the gallows; and if the Father hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the story I told the police was true, and I had really&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, brother, hush! I won&rsquo;t hear you. What you are saying is for God&rsquo;s
      ear only, and, whatever you have done, God will judge your soul in mercy.
      We have only to ask him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, then; the last sands are running out!&rdquo; and he strove to rise and
      kneel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie still, brother: God will accept the humiliation of your soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, let me up; let me kneel beside you. The prayer for the dying&mdash;say
      it with me, Brother Storm; let us say it together. &lsquo;O Lord, save&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;O Lord, save thy servant, </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Which putteth his trust in thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Send him help from thy holy place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And ... evermore ... mightily defend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let the enemy have no advantage over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nor the ... wicked&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Be unto him, O Lord, a strong tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;From the&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;O Lord, hear our prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul! Paul! Speak to me! Speak! Don&rsquo;t leave me! We shall console and
      support each other. You shall come to me, I will go to you. No matter
      about the religious life. One word! My lad, my lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Brother Paul had gone. The captured eagle with the broken wing had
      slipped its chain at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the terrible peace which followed the air of the room seemed to become
      empty. John Storm felt chill and dizzy, and a great awe fell upon him. The
      courage which he had built up in sight of Brother Paul&rsquo;s sufferings ebbed
      rapidly away, and his old fear of rule flowed back. He must carry the lay
      brother to his cell; he must be ignorant of his death; he must conceal and
      cover up everything. The moon had gone by this time, for it was near to
      morning, and the shadows of night were contending with the leaden hues of
      dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and listened. The house was still quite silent. He
      walked on tip-toe to the end of the corridor, pausing at every cell. There
      was no sound anywhere, except the sonorous breathing of some heavy sleeper
      and the ticking of the clock in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he returned to the chamber of death, and, lifting the dead man in his
      arms, he carried him back to the room which he had left as a living man.
      The body was light, and he scarcely felt its weight, for the limbs under
      the cassock had dried up like withered twigs. He stretched them out on the
      bed that they might be fit for death&rsquo;s composing hand, and then closed the
      eyes and laid the hands together on the breast, and took the heavy cross
      that hung about the neck and put it as well as he could into the nerveless
      fingers. By this time the daylight had overcome the shadows of the
      fore-dawn, and the ruddy glow of morning was gliding into the room.
      Traffic was beginning to stir in the sleeping city, and a cart was
      rattling down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance more he gave at the dead brother&rsquo;s face, and going down on his
      knees beside it he said a prayer and crossed himself. Then he rose and
      stole back to his room and shut the door without a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a boundless relief when this was done, and partly from relief
      and partly from exhaustion he fell asleep. He slept for a few minutes
      only, but sleep knows no time, and a moment in its garden of forgetfulness
      will wipe out the bitterness of a life. When he awoke he stretched out his
      hand as he was accustomed to do and rapped three times on the wall. But
      the tide of consciousness returned to him even as he did so, and in the
      dead silence that followed his very heart grew cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Father Minister began to awaken the household. His deep call and
      the muffled answer which followed it rose higher and higher and came
      nearer and nearer, and every step as he approached seemed to beat upon
      John Storm&rsquo;s brain. He had reached the topmost story&mdash;he was coming
      down the corridor&mdash;he was standing before the door of the dead man&rsquo;s
      cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benedicamus Domino!&rdquo; he called, but no answer came back to him. He called
      again, and there was a short and terrible silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm held his breath and listened. By the faint click of the lock he
      knew that the door had been opened, and that the Father Minister had
      entered the room. There was a muttered exclamation and then another short
      silence, and after that there came the click of the lock again. The door
      had been closed, and the Father Minister had resumed his rounds. When he
      called at the door of John Storm&rsquo;s cell not a tone of his voice would have
      told that anything unusual had taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang, and the brothers trooped down the stairs. Presently the
      low, droning sound of their voices came up from the chapel where they were
      saying Lauds. But the service had scarcely ended when the Father
      Minister&rsquo;s step was on the stair again. This time another was with him. It
      was the doctor. They entered the brother&rsquo;s room and closed the door behind
      them. From the other side of the wall John Storm followed every movement
      and every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he has gone at last, poor soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he long dead, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some hours, certainly. Was there nobody with him then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t wish for anybody. And then you told us that nothing could he
      done, and that he might live a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, a dying man, you know&mdash;&mdash; But how strangely composed he
      looks! And then the cross on his breast as well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very devout and penitent. He made his last devotion yesterday with
      an intensity of joy such as I have rarely witnessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His eyes closed, too! You are sure there was nobody with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence and then the doctor said, &ldquo;Well, he has
      slipped his anchor at last, poor soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has launched on the ocean of the love of God. May we all be as
      ready when our call comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came back to the corridor, and John heard their footsteps going
      downstairs. Then for some minutes there were unusual noises below. Rapid
      steps were coming and going, the hall bell was ringing, and the front door
      was opening and shutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Brother Andrew came with the breakfast. He was obviously
      excited, and putting down the tray he began to busy himself in the room
      and to sing, as before, in, his pretence of a Gregorian chant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Paul is dead&mdash;he died in the night&mdash;there was nobody
      with him&mdash;we are sorry he has left us, but glad he is at peace-God
      rest the soul of our poor Brother Paul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Easter Day. At midday service in the church the brothers sang the
      Easter hymn, and a mighty longing took hold of John Storm for his own
      resurrection from his living grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day there was much coming and going between the world outside and the
      adjoining cell, and late at night there were heavy and shambling
      footsteps, and even some coarse and ribald talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear a &lsquo;and, myte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they won&rsquo;t have their backs broke as carry this one downstairs. He
      ain&rsquo;t a Danny Lambert, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t feed ye on Bovril in plyces syme as this. I&rsquo;ll lay ye odds
      yer own looking-glass wouldn&rsquo;t know ye arter three months &lsquo;ard on religion
      and dry tommy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pawses me &lsquo;ow people tyke to it. Gimme my pint of four-half, and my
      own childring to follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Early on the following morning a stroke rang out on the bell, then another
      stroke, and again another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the knell,&rdquo; thought John.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of the lay brothers came up and passed into the room. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; said
      one, as if giving a signal, and then they passed out again with the
      measured steps of men who bear a burden. &ldquo;They are taking him away,&rdquo; he
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to their retreating footsteps. &ldquo;He has gone,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passing bell continued to ring out minute by minute, and presently
      there was the sound of singing. &ldquo;It is the service for the dead,&rdquo; he told
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while both the bell and the singing ceased, and then there was no
      sound anywhere except the dull rumble of the traffic in the city outside&mdash;the
      deep murmur of the mighty sea that flows on forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I doing?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;What bolts and bars are keeping me?
      I am guilty of a folly. I am degrading myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At midday Brother Andrew came with his food. &ldquo;Brother Paul is buried,&rdquo; he
      sang, &ldquo;the coffin was beautiful&mdash;it was covered with flowers&mdash;we
      buried him in his cassock, with his beads and psalter&mdash;we left the
      cross on his breast&mdash;he loved it and died with it in his hands&mdash;the
      Father has come home&mdash;he said mass this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm could bear no more. He pushed the lay brother aside and made
      straight for the Superior&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father was sitting before the fire, looking sad and low and weary. He
      rose to his feet with a painful smile, as John broke into his cell with
      blazing eyes, and cried in a choking voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I can not live the religious life any longer! I have tried to&mdash;with
      all my soul and strength I&rsquo;ve tried to, but I can not, I can not! This
      life of prayer and penance and meditation is stifling me, and corrupting
      me, and crushing the man out of me, and I can not bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been deceiving you and myself and everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deceiving me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was for my own ends and not Brother Paul&rsquo;s that I helped him to break
      obedience, and so injure his health and hasten his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, had a sister in the world, and my heart was hungry for news of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one nearer than a sister&mdash;and all my spiritual life has been a
      sham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Father. I shall love you and honour you and revere you
      always; but I must break my obedience and leave you, or I shall be a
      hypocrite and a liar and a cheat.&rdquo;

      XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dinner party at the Home Secretary&rsquo;s took place on Wednesday, in the
      week after Easter. It had rained during the day, but cleared up toward
      night. Glory and Koenig had taken an omnibus to Waterloo Place, and then
      walked up the wide street that ends with the wide steps going down to the
      park. Two lines of lofty stone houses go off to right and left, and the
      house they were going to was in one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footman received them with sombre but easy familiarity. The artistes?
      Yes. They were shown into the library, and light refreshments were brought
      in to them on a tray. Three other members of the choral company were there
      already. Glory was seeing it all for the first time, and Koenig was
      describing and explaining everything in broken whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A band was playing in the well of the circular staircase, and a second
      footman stood in an alcove behind an outwork of hats and overcoats. The
      first footman reappeared. Were the artistes ready to go to the
      drawing-room?
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed him upstairs. The band had stopped, and there was the
      distant hum of voices and the crackle of plates. Waiters were coming and
      going from the dining-room, and the butler stood at the door giving
      instructions. At one moment there was a glimpse within of ladies in
      gorgeous dresses, and a table laden with silver and bright with
      fairy-lamps. When the door opened the voices grew louder, when it closed
      the sounds were deadened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper landing opened on to a <i>salon</i> which had three windows down
      to the ground, and half of each stood open. Outside there was a wide
      terrace lit up by Chinese and Moorish lanterns. Beyond was the dark patch
      of the park, and farther still the towers of the Abbey and the clock of
      Westminster, but the great light was not burning to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De House naivare sits on Vednesday night,&rdquo; said Koenig.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed into the drawing-room, which was empty. The standing lamps
      were subdued by coverings of yellow-silk lace. There was a piano and an
      organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ve&rsquo;ll stay here,&rdquo; said Koenig, opening the organ, and Glory stood by his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently there were ripples of laughter, sounds of quick,
      indistinguishable voices, waves of heliotrope, and the rustle of silk
      dresses on the stairs. Then the ladies entered. Two or three of them who
      were elderly leaned their right hands on the arms of younger women, and
      walked with ebony sticks in their left. An old lady wearing black satin
      and a large brooch came last. Koenig rose and bowed to her. Glory prepared
      to bow also, but the lady gave her a side inclination of the head as she
      sat in a well-cushioned chair under a lamp, and Glory&rsquo;s bow was abridged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies sat and talked, and Glory tried to listen. There were little
      nothings, punctuated by trills of feminine laughter. She thought the
      conversation rather silly. More than once the ladies lifted their
      lorgnettes and looked at her. She set her lips hard and looked back
      without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footman brought tea on a tray, and then there was the tinkle of cup and
      saucer, and more laughter. The lady in satin looked round at Koenig, and
      he began to play the organ. He played superbly, but nobody seemed to
      listen. When he finished there was a pause, and everybody said: &ldquo;Oh, thank
      you; we&rsquo;re all&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then the talk began again. The
      vocal soloist sang some ballad of Schumann, and as long as it lasted an
      old lady with an ear-trumpet sat at the foot of the piano, and a young
      girl spoke into it. When it was over, everybody said, &ldquo;Ah, that dear old
      thing!&rdquo; Then there was an outbreak of deeper voices from the stairs, with
      lustier laughter and heavier steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen appeared, talking loudly as they entered. Koenig was back at
      the organ and playing as if he wished it were the &lsquo;cello and the drum and
      the whole brass band. Glory was watching everything; it was beginning to
      be very funny. Suddenly it ceased to be so. One of the gentlemen was
      saying, in a tired drawl: &ldquo;Old Koenig again! How the old boy lasts! Seem
      to have been hearing&mdash;him since the Flood, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Lord Robert Ure. Glory caught one glimpse of him, then looked down
      at her slipper and pawed at the carpet. He put his glass in his eye,
      screwed up the left side of his face, and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      An elderly man with a leonine head came up to the organ and said: &ldquo;Got
      anything comic, Mr. Koenig? All had the influenza last winter, you know,
      and lost our taste for the classical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, sir,&rdquo; said Koenig, and then turning to Glory he touched
      her wrist. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s de pulse? Ach Gott! beating same like a child&rsquo;s! Now is
      your turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory made a step forward, and the talk grew louder as she was observed.
      She heard fragments of it. &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is she a professional?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;a
      lady.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sing, does she, or is it whistling?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s a professional; we
      had her last year; she does conjuring.&rdquo; And then the voice she had heard
      before said, &ldquo;By Jove, old fellow, your young friend looks like a red
      standard rose!&rdquo; She did not flinch. There was a nervous tremor of the lip,
      a scarcely perceptible curl of it, and then she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mylecharaine, a Manx ballad in the Anglo-Manx, about a farmer who
      was a miser. His daughter was ashamed of him because he dressed shabbily
      and wore yellow stockings; but he answered that if he didn&rsquo;t the stocking
      wouldn&rsquo;t be yellow that would be forthcoming for her dowry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang, recited, talked, acted, lived the old man, and there was not a
      sound until she finished, except laughter and the clapping of hands. Then
      there was a general taking of breath and a renewed outbreak of gossip.
      &ldquo;Really, really! How&mdash;er&mdash;natural!&rdquo; &ldquo;Natural&mdash;that&rsquo;s it,
      natural. I never&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Rather good, certainly; in fact,
      quite amusing.&rdquo; &ldquo;What dialect is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Irish, of course.&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course, of
      course,&rdquo; with many nods and looks of knowledge, and a buzz and a flutter
      of understanding. &ldquo;Hope she&rsquo;ll do something else.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hush! she&rsquo;s
      beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Ny Kiree fo Niaghtey, a rugged old wail of how the sheep were lost
      on the mountains in a great snowstorm; but it was full of ineffable
      melancholy. The ladies dropped their lorgnettes, the men&rsquo;s glasses fell
      from their eyes and their faces straightened, the noisy old soul with the
      ear-trumpet sitting under Glory&rsquo;s arm was snuffling audibly, and at the
      next moment there was a chorus of admiring remarks. &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my word, this is
      something new, don&rsquo;t you know!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fine girl too!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fine! Irish girls often
      run to it.&rdquo; &ldquo;That old miser&mdash;you could see him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her next piece?&mdash;something funny, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Koenig&rsquo;s pride was measureless, and Glory did not get off lightly. He
      cleared the floor for her, and announced that with the indulgence, etc.,
      the young artiste would give an imitation of common girls singing in the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company laughed until they screamed, and when the song was finished
      Glory was being overwhelmed with congratulations and inquiries, &ldquo;Charming!
      All your pieces are charming! But really, my dear young lady, you must be
      more careful about our feelings. Those sheep now&mdash;it was really quite
      too sad.&rdquo; The old lady with the ear-trumpet asked Glory whether she could
      go on for the whole of an afternoon, and if she felt much fatigued
      sometimes, and didn&rsquo;t often catch cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lady in satin came to her relief at last. &ldquo;You will need some
      refreshment,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me see now if I can not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and
      she lifted her glass and looked round the room. At the next moment a voice
      that made a shudder pass over her said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps <i>I</i> may have the pleasure of taking Miss Quayle down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Drake. His eyes were as blue and boyish as before, but Glory
      observed at once that he had grown a mustache, and that his face and
      figure were firmer and more manlike. A few minutes afterward they had
      passed through one of the windows on to the terrace and were walking to
      and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cool and quiet out there after the heat and hubbub of the
      drawing-room. The night was soft and still. Hardly a breath of wind
      stirred the leaves of the trees in the park below. The rain had left a
      dewy moistness in the air, and a fragrant mist was lying over the grass.
      The stars were out, and the moon had just risen behind the towers of
      Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory was flushed with her success. Her eyes sparkled and her step was
      light and free. Drake touched her hand as it lay on his arm and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that I&rsquo;ve got you to myself I must begin by scolding you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another and smiled. &ldquo;Have I displeased you so much
      to-night?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that. Where have you been all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if you only knew!&rdquo; She had stopped and was looking into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>want</i> to know. Why didn&rsquo;t you answer my letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your letter?&rdquo; She was clutching at the lilies of the valley in her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tapped her hand lightly and said, &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll not quarrel this time,
      only don&rsquo;t do it again, you know, or else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She recovered herself and laughed. Her voice had a silvery ring, and he
      thought it was an enchanting smile that played upon her face. They resumed
      their walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now about to-night. You have had a success, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I always knew you must have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was proud and happy. He began to be grave and severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the drawing-room after dinner is no proper scene for your talents.
      The audience is not in the right place or the right mood. Guests and
      auditors&mdash;their duties clash. Besides, to tell you the truth, art is
      a dark continent to people like these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were kind to me, at all events,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, yes. The last new man&mdash;the last new monkey&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was laughing again and swinging along on his arm as if her feet hardly
      touched the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; I am only thinking how polite you are,&rdquo; and then they looked at
      each other again and laughed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mild radiance of the stars was dying into the brighter light of the
      moon. A bird somewhere in the dark trees below had mistaken the moonlight
      for the dawn, and was making its early call. The clock at Westminster was
      striking eleven, and there was the deep rumble of traffic from the unseen
      streets round about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; said Glory. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe that this can be the
      same London that is so full of casinos and clubs and-monasteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what does a girl like you know about such places?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had dropped his arm and was looking over the balcony. The sound of
      voices came from the red windows behind them. Then the soloist began to
      sing again. His second ballad was the Erl King:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Du liebes Kind, komm&rsquo; geh&rsquo; mit mir!
  Gar schöne Spiele spiel&rsquo; ich mit dir.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news of John Storm?&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you would like him to come out again&mdash;now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was a step behind them, and a soft voice said, &ldquo;I
      want you to introduce me, Mr. Drake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a lady of eight or nine and twenty, wearing short hair brushed
      upward and backward in the manner of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Rosa&mdash;Miss Rosa Macquarrie,&rdquo; said Drake. &ldquo;Rosa is a journalist,
      and a great friend of mine, Glory. If you want fame, she keeps some of the
      keys of it, and if you want friendship&mdash;&mdash; But I&rsquo;ll leave you
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;I want you to let me know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve seen you before&mdash;and spoken to you,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory was laughing awkwardly. &ldquo;Never mind now! Some other time perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people inside are raving about your voice. &lsquo;Where does it come from?&rsquo; 
      they are saying&mdash;&lsquo;from a palace or Ratcliffe Highway?&rsquo; But I think <i>I</i>
      know. It comes from your heart, my dear. You have lived and and loved and
      suffered&mdash;and so have I. Here we are in our smart frocks, dear, but
      we belong to another world altogether and are the only working women in
      the company. Perhaps I can help you a little, and you have helped me
      already. I may know you, may I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a deep light in Glory&rsquo;s eyes and a momentary quiver of her
      eyelids. Then without a word she put her arms about Rosa&rsquo;s neck and kissed
      her,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure of you,&rdquo; said Rosa. Her voice was low and husky. &ldquo;Your name is
      Glory, isn&rsquo;t it? It wasn&rsquo;t for nothing you were given that name. God gave
      it you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party was breaking up and Koenig came for &ldquo;his star.&rdquo; &ldquo;I vill give you
      an engagement for one, two, tree year, upon my vord I vill,&rdquo; he said as
      they went downstairs. While the butler took him back to the library to
      sign his receipt and receive his cheque, Glory stood waiting by the
      billiard table in the hall and Drake and Lord Robert stepped up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until when?&rdquo; said Drake with a smile, but Glory pretended not to
      understand him. &ldquo;I dare say you thought me cynical to-night, Glory. I only
      meant that if you are to follow this profession I want you to make the
      best of it. Why not look for a wider scene? Why not go directly to the
      public?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But de lady is engaged to me for tree year,&rdquo; said Koenig, coming up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake looked at Glory, who shook her head, and then Koenig made an effort
      at explanation. It was an understood thing. He had taught her, taken her
      into his house, found her in a Sunday&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Drake interrupted him. If they could help Miss Quayle to a better
      market for her genius Mr. Koenig need be no loser by the change. Then
      Koenig was pacified, and Drake handed Glory to a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re good friends again, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; he said, touching her hand lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a letter from Aunt Rachel waiting for her at the Priory. Aunt
      Anna didn&rsquo;t like these frequent changes, and she had no faith in music or
      musicians either, but the Parson thought Anna too censorious, and as for
      Mr. Koenig&rsquo;s Sunday evening companies, he had no doubt they were of
      Germans chiefly, and that they came to talk of Martin Luther and to sing
      his hymn. Sorry to say his infirmities were increasing; the burden of his
      years was upon him, and he was looking feeble and old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory slept little that night. On going to her room she threw up the
      window and sat in front of it, that the soft night breeze might play on
      her hot lips and cheeks. The moon was high and the garden was slumbering
      under its gentle light. Everything around was hushed, and there was no
      sound anywhere except the far-off rumble of the great city, as of the wind
      in distant trees. She was thinking of a question which Drake had put to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I should?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      And through the silence there was the unheard melody of the German song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Du liebes Kind, komm&rsquo; geh&rsquo; mit mir!
  Gar schöne Spiele spiel&rsquo; ich mit dir.

      XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Priory&mdash;May Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Aunt Rachel: The great evening is over! Such dresses, such diamonds&mdash;you
      never saw the like! The smart folks are just like other human beings, and
      I was not the tiniest bit afraid of them. My own part of the programme
      went off pretty well, I think. Mr. Koenig had arranged the harmonies and
      accompaniments of some of our old Manx songs, so I sang Mylecharaine, and
      they listened and clapped, and then Ny Kiree fo Niaghtey, and they cried
      (and so did I), and then I imitated some work-girls singing in the
      streets, and they laughed and laughed until I laughed too, and then they
      laughed because I was laughing, and we all laughed together. It was over
      and done before I knew where I was, and everybody was covering me with&mdash;well,
      no, not kisses, as grandfather used to do, but the society equivalent&mdash;ices
      and jellies&mdash;which the gentlemen were rushing about wildly to get for
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this is as nothing compared to what is to happen next. I mustn&rsquo;t
      whisper a word about it yet, so false face must hide what the false heart
      doth know. You&rsquo;ll <i>have</i> to forgive me if I succeed, for nothing is
      wicked in this world except failure, you know, and a little sin must be a
      great virtue if it has grown to be big enough, you see. There! How
      sagacious of me! You didn&rsquo;t know what a philosopher you had in the family,
      did you, my dears?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be on the 24th of May. That will be the Queen&rsquo;s birthday over
      again; and when I think of all that has happened since the last one I feel
      as romantic as a schoolgirl and as sentimental as a nursery maid.
      Naturally I am in a fearful flurry over the whole affair, and, to tell the
      truth, I have hied me to the weird sisters on the subject&mdash;that is to
      say, I have been to a fortune-teller, and spent a &lsquo;goolden&rsquo; half-sovereign
      on the creature at one fell swoop. But she predicts wonderful things for
      me, so I am satisfied. The newspapers are to blaze with my name; I am to
      have a dazzling success and become the idol of the hour&mdash;all of which
      is delightful and entrancing, and quite reasonable at the money.
      Grandfather will reprove me for tempting Providence, and, of course, John
      Storm, if he knew it, would say that I shouldn&rsquo;t do such things under any
      circumstances; yet to tell me I oughtn&rsquo;t to do this and I oughtn&rsquo;t to do
      that is like saying I oughtn&rsquo;t to have red hair and I oughtn&rsquo;t to catch
      the measles. I can&rsquo;t help it! I can&rsquo;t help it! so what&rsquo;s the good of
      breaking one&rsquo;s heart about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hadn&rsquo;t got to wait for <i>Hecate et cie</i> for what related to the
      newspapers. You must know, dear Aunt Rachel, that I <i>did</i> meet Mr.
      Drake at the house of the Home Secretary, and he introduced me to a Miss
      Rosa Macquarrie, who is no longer very young or beautiful, but a dear for
      all that! and she, being a journalist, has bruited my praises abroad, with
      the result that all the world is ringing with my virtues. Listen, all men
      and women, while I sound mine own glory out of a column as long as the
      Duke of York&rsquo;s:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She is young and tall, and has auburn hair&rsquo; (always thought it was red
      myself) &lsquo;and large gray eyes, one of which seems at a distance to be
      brown&rsquo; (it squints), &lsquo;giving an effect of humour and coquetry and power
      rarely, if ever, seen in any other face.... Her voice has startling
      varieties of tone, being at one moment soft, cooing, and liquid, and at
      another wild, weird, and plaintive; and her face, which is not strictly
      beautiful&rsquo; (oh!), &lsquo;but striking and unforgetable, has an extraordinary
      range of expression.... She sings, recites, speaks, laughs, and cries
      (literally), and some of her selections are given in a sort of Irish <i>patois</i>&rsquo; 
      (oh, my beloved Manx!) &lsquo;that comes from her girlish lips with charming
      vivacity and drollness.&rsquo; All of which, though it is quite right, and no
      more than my due, <i>of course</i>, made me sob so long and loud that my
      good little hippopotamus came upstairs to comfort me, but, finding me
      lying on the floor, he threw up his hands and cried, &lsquo;<i>Ach</i> Gott! I
      t&rsquo;ought it vas a young lady, but vhatever is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet wae&rsquo;s me! Sometimes I think how many poor girls there must be who
      have never had a chance, while I have had so many and such glorious ones;
      who can not get anybody to listen to them, while I am so pampered and
      praised; who live in narrow alleys and serve in little dark shops, where
      men and men-things talk to them as they can&rsquo;t talk to their sisters and
      wives, while I am held aloft in an atmosphere of admiration and respect:
      who earn their bread in clubs and casinos, where they breathe the air of
      the hotbeds of hell, while I am surrounded by everything that ennobles and
      refines! O God, forgive me if I am a vain, presumptuous creature, laughing
      at everything and everybody, and sometimes forgetting that many a poor
      girl who is being tossed about in London is just as good as me, and as
      clever and as brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But hoot! &lsquo;I likes to be jolly and I allus is.&rsquo; So Aunt Anna doesn&rsquo;t like
      this Wandering Jew existence! Well, do you know I always thought I should
      love a gipsy life. It has a sense of movement that must be delightful, and
      then I love going fast. Do you remember the days when &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; used to
      take the bit in his teeth and bolt with me! Lo, there was little me,
      cross-legged on his bare back, with nothing to trust to but Providence and
      a pair of rope reins; but, oh my! I couldn&rsquo;t breathe for excitement and
      delight! Dear old maddest of created &lsquo;Caesars,&rsquo; I feel as if I were
      whacking at him yet! What do you think of me? But we &lsquo;that be females are
      the same craythurs alwis&rsquo;, as old Chalse used to say, and what a woman is
      in the cradle she continues to be to the end. There again! I wonder who
      told you that, young lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to tell you the truth at last, dear Aunt Rachel, there is something I
      have kept back until now, because I couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of any of
      you being anxious on my account, especially grandfather, who thinks of
      Glory so much too often as things are. Can&rsquo;t you guess what it is? I
      couldn&rsquo;t help taking up my life of Wandering Jew, because I was dismissed
      from the hospital! Didn&rsquo;t you understand that, my dears? I thought I was
      telling you over and over again. Yes, dismissed as unfit to be a nurse,
      and so I was, according to the order of the institution first, and human
      love and pity last. But all&rsquo;s well that ends well, you know, and now that
      my wanderings seem to be over and I am in my right place at length, I feel
      like one who is coming out of a long imprisonment, a great peril, a
      darkness deeper even than John Storm&rsquo;s cell. And if I ever become a famous
      woman, and good men will listen to me, I will tell them to be tender and
      merciful to poor girls who are trying to live in London and be good and
      strong, and that the true chivalry is to band themselves together against
      the other men who are selfish and cruel and impure. Oh, this great,
      glorious, devilish, divine London! It must stand to the human world as the
      seething, boiling, bubbling waters of Niagara do to the world of Nature.
      Either a girl floats over its rapids like a boat, and in that case she
      draws her breath and thanks God, or she is tossed into its whirlpool like
      a dead body and goes round and round until she finds the vortex and is
      swallowed up!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I have blown off my steam, and now to business. Mr. Drake is to
      give a luncheon party in his rooms on the twenty-fourth, in honour of my
      experiment, but the great event itself will not come off until nearly
      half-past nine that night. By that time the sun will have set over the
      back of the sea at Peel, the blackbird will have given you his last
      &lsquo;guy-smook,&rsquo; and all the world will be dropping asleep. Now, if you&rsquo;ll
      only remember to say just then, &rsquo;God bless Glory!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll feel strong and big
      and brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your poor, silly, sentimental girlie, Glory.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some weeks had passed, and it was the morning of the last day of John
      Storm&rsquo;s residence at Bishopsgate Street. After calling the Brotherhood,
      the Father had entered John&rsquo;s room and was resting on the end of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite determined to leave us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite determined, Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father sighed deeply, and said in broken sentences: &lsquo;Our house is
      passing through terrible trials, my son. Perhaps we did wrong to come
      here. There is no cross in our foundations, and we have built on a worldly
      footing. &lsquo;Unless the Lord build the house&mdash;&rsquo; It was good of you to
      delay the execution of your purpose, but now that the time has come&mdash;I
      had set my heart on you, my son. I am an old man now, and something of the
      affection of the natural father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, if you only knew&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I know, I know. You have suffered, and it is not for me to
      reproach you. The novitiate has its great joys, but it has its great
      trials also. Self has to be got rid of, faith has to be exerted, obedience
      has to be learned, and, above all, the heart has to be detached from its
      idols in the world&mdash;a devoted mother, it may be; a dear sister;
      perhaps a dearer one still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment. John&rsquo;s head was down; he could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you wish to return to the world only shows that you came before you
      heard the call of God. Some other voice seemed to speak to you, and you
      listened and thought it was God&rsquo;s voice. But God&rsquo;s voice will come to you
      yet, and you will hear it and answer it and not another&mdash;&mdash; Have
      you anywhere to go to when you leave this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the home of a good woman. I have written to her&mdash;I think she
      will receive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you brought with you will be returned, and if you want money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I came to you as a beggar&mdash;let me leave you as a beggar too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing more, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s voice was scarcely audible. &ldquo;You are breaking obedience by
      leaving us before the end of your novitiate, and the community must
      separate itself from you, though you are only a novice, as from one who
      has violated his vow and cast himself off from grace. This will have to be
      done before you cross our threshold. It is our duty to the Brotherhood&mdash;it
      is also our duty to God. You understand that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be in the church, a few minutes before midday service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father rose to go. &ldquo;Then that is all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father&rsquo;s voice was breaking. &ldquo;Good-bye, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Father, and God forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A leather trunk which John had brought with him on the day he came to the
      Brotherhood was returned to his room, containing the clothes he had worn
      in the outer world, as well as his purse and watch and other belongings.
      He dressed himself in his habit as a clergyman, and put the cassock of the
      society over it, for he knew that to remove that must be part of the
      ordeal of his expulsion. Then the bell rang for breakfast, and he went
      down to the refectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers received him in silence, hardly looking up as he entered,
      though by their furtive glances he could plainly see that he was the only
      subject that occupied their thoughts. When the meal was over he tried to
      mingle among them, that he might say farewell to as many as were willing
      that he should do so. Some gave him their hands with prompt good will,
      some avoided him, some turned their backs upon him altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if his reception in the refectory was chilling, his welcome in the
      courtyard was warm enough. At the first sound of his footsteps on the
      paved way the dog came from his quarters under the sycamore. One moment
      the creature stood and looked at him with its sad and bloodshot eyes;
      then, with a bound, it threw its fore paws on his breast, and then plunged
      around him and uttered deep bays that were like the roar of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat on the seat and caressed the dog, and his heart grew full and
      happy. The morning was bright with sunshine, the air was fragrant with the
      leafage of spring, and birds were singing and rejoicing in the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Brother Andrew came and sat beside him. The lay brother, like a
      human dog, had been following him about all the morning, and now in his
      feeble way he began to talk of his mother, and to wonder if John would
      ever see her. Her name was Pincher, and she was a good woman. She lived in
      Crook Lane, Crown Street, Soho, and kept house for his brother, who was a
      pawnbroker. But his brother, poor fellow! was much given to drink, and
      perhaps that had been a reason why he himself had left home. John promised
      to call on her, and then Brother Andrew began to cry. The sprawling
      features of the great fellow were almost laughable to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang for Terce. While the brothers were at prayers, John took his
      last look over the house. With the dog at his heels&mdash;the old thing
      seemed determined to lose sight of him no more&mdash;he passed slowly
      through the hall and into the community room and up the stairs and down
      the top corridor. He looked again at every inscription on the walls,
      though he knew them all by heart and had read them a hundred times. When
      he came to his own cell he was touched by a strange tenderness. Place
      where he had thought so much, prayed so much, suffered so much&mdash;it
      was dear to him, after all! He went up on to the tower. How often he had
      been drawn there as by a devilish fascination! The great city looked
      innocent enough now under its mantle of sunlight, dotted over with green,
      but how dense, how difficult! Then the bell rang for midday service,
      though it was not yet noon, and he went down to the hall. The brothers
      were there preparing to go into the church. The order of the procession
      was the same as on the day of his dedication, except that Brother Paul was
      no longer with them&mdash;Brother Andrew going first with the cross, then
      the lay brothers, then the religious, then the Father, and John Storm last
      of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the courtyard was full of sunshine, the church looked dark and
      gloomy. Curtains were drawn across the windows, and the altar was draped
      as for a funeral. As soon as the brothers had taken their places in the
      choir the Father stood on the altar steps and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any member of this community has one unfaithful thought of going back
      to the outer world, I charge him to come to this altar now. But woe to him
      through whom the offence cometh! Woe to him who turns back after taking up
      the golden plough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was kneeling in his place in the second row of the choir. The eyes of
      the community were upon him. He hesitated a moment, then rose and stepped
      up to the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the Father, &ldquo;it is not yet too late. I see your fate as
      plainly as I see you now. Shall I tell you what it is? Can you bear to
      hear it? I see you going out into a world which has nothing to satisfy the
      cravings of your soul. I see you foredoomed to failure and suffering and
      despair. I see you coming back to us within a year with a broken and
      bleeding heart. I see you taking the vows of lifelong consecration. Can
      you face that future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father drew a long breath. &ldquo;It is inevitable,&rdquo; he said; and, taking a
      book from the altar, he read the awful service of the degradation:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;By the authority of God Almighty, Father [Symbol: Patée], Son, and
      Holy Ghost, and by our own authority, we, the members of the Society of
      the Holy Gethsemane, do take away from thee the habit of our Order, and
      depose and degrade and deprive thee of all rights and privileges in the
      spiritual goods and prayers which, by the grace of God, are done among
      us.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen! Amen!&rdquo; said the brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the reading of the service John had been kneeling. The Father
      motioned to him to rise, and proceeded to remove the cord with which he
      had bound him at his consecration. When this was done, he signalled to
      Brother Andrew to take off the cassock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell was tolled. The Father dropped on his knees. The brothers, hoarse
      and husky, began to sing <i>In exitu Israel de Aegypto</i>. Their heads
      were down, their voices seemed to come up out of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all over now. John Storm turned about, hardly able to see his way.
      Brother Andrew went before him to open the door of the sacristy. The lay
      brother was crying audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was still shining in the courtyard, and the birds were still
      singing and rejoicing. The first thing of which John was conscious was
      that the dog was licking his rigid fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he was in the little covered passage to the street, and
      Brother Andrew was opening the iron gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out his hand, then remembered that he was an excommunicated
      man, and tried to draw it back; but the lay brother had snatched at it and
      lifted it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog was following him into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back, old friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He patted the old creature on the head, and Brother Andrew laid hold of it
      by the loose skin at its neck. A hansom was waiting for him with his trunk
      on the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victoria Square, Westminster,&rdquo; he called. The cab was moving off, when
      there was a growl and a lurch&mdash;the dog had broken away and was
      running after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      How crowded the streets were! How deafening was the traffic! The church
      bell was ringing for midday service. What a thin tinkle it made out there,
      yet how deep was its boom within! Stock Exchange men with their leisurely
      activity were going in by their seven doorways to their great market place
      in Capel Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to feel a boundless relief. How his heart was beating! With what
      a strange and deep emotion he found himself once more in the world!
      Driving in the dense and devious thoroughfares was like sailing on a cross
      sea outside a difficult headland. He could smell the brine and feel the
      flick of the foam on his lips and cheeks. It was liberty, it was life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling anxious about the dog, he drew up the cab for a moment. The
      faithful creature was running under the driver&rsquo;s seat. Before the cab
      could start again a line of sandwich men had passed in front of it. Their
      boards contained a single word. The word was &ldquo;GLORIA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw it, yet it barely arrested his consciousness. Somehow it seemed
      like an echo from the existence he had left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noises of life were as wine in his veins now. He was burning with
      impatience to overtake his arrears of knowledge, to see what the world had
      gone through in his absence. Leaning over the door of the hansom, he read
      the names of the streets and the signs over the shops, and tried to
      identify the houses which had been rebuilt and the thoroughfares which had
      been altered. But the past was the past, and the clock would turn back for
      no man. These men and women in the streets knew all that had happened. The
      poorest beggar on the pavement knew more than he did. Nearly a year of his
      life was gone&mdash;in prayer, in penance, in fasting, in visions, in
      dreams&mdash;dropped out, left behind, and lost forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going by the Bank, the cab drew up again to allow a line of omnibuses to
      pass into Cheapside. Every omnibus had its board for advertisements, and
      nearly every board contained the word he had seen before&mdash;&ldquo;GLORIA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the name of some music-hall singer,&rdquo; he told himself. But the name
      had begun to trouble him. It had stirred the fibres of memory, and made
      him think of the past&mdash;of his yacht, of Peel, of his father, and
      finally of Glory&mdash;and again of Glory&mdash;and yet again of Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that flags were flying on the Mansion House and on the Bank, and,
      pushing up the trap of the hansom, he asked if anything unusual was going
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd, down&rsquo;t ye know what day it is terday, sir? It&rsquo;s the dear ole
      laidy&rsquo;s birthday. That&rsquo;s why all the wimming&rsquo;s going abart in their penny
      carridges. Been through a hillness, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, something of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thort so, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the cab started afresh he began to tell himself what he was going to
      do in the future. He was going to work among the poor and the outcast, the
      oppressed and the fallen. He was going to search for them and find them in
      their haunts of sin and misery. Nothing was to be too mean for him.
      Nothing was to be common or unclean. No matter about his own good name! No
      matter if he was only one man in a million! The kingdom of heaven was like
      a grain of mustard seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came within sight of St. Paul&rsquo;s the golden cross on the dome was
      flashing like a fiery finger in the blaze of the midday sun. That was the
      true ensign! It was a monstrous and wicked fallacy, a gloomy and narrow
      formula, that religion had to do with the affairs of the other world only.
      Work was religion! Work was prayer! Work was praise! Work was the love of
      man and the glory of God!
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorious gospel! Great and deathless symbol!

    </h2>
    <p>
      Behind Buckingham Palace there is a little square of modest houses
      standing back from the tide of traffic and nearly always as quiet as a
      cloister. At one angle of the square there is a house somewhat larger than
      the rest but just as simple and unassuming. In the dining-room of this
      house an elderly lady was sitting down to lunch alone, with the covers
      laid for another at the opposite end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hae ye the spare room ready, Emma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the sheets done airing? And baith the pillows? And the pillow-slips&mdash;and
      everything finished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid was answering &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to each of these questions when a hansom cab
      came rattling up to the front of the house, and the old lady leaped out of
      her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s himself!&rdquo; she cried, and she ran like a girl to the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door had been opened before she got there, and a deep voice was
      saying, &ldquo;Is Mrs. Callender&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s John! My gracious! It&rsquo;s John Storm!&rdquo; the old woman cried, and she
      lifted both hands as if to fling herself into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My guidness, laddie, but you gave poor auld Jane sic a start! Expected
      ye? To be sure we expected you, and terribly thrang we&rsquo;ve been all morning
      making ready. Only my daft auld brain must have been a wee ajee. But,&rdquo;
       smiling through her tears, &ldquo;has a body never a cheek, that you must be
      kissing at her hand? And is this your dog?&rdquo; looking down at the
      bloodhound. &ldquo;Welcome? Why, of course it&rsquo;s welcome. What was I saying the
      day, Emma? &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like fine to have a dog,&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t I? and here it is to our
      hand.&mdash;Away with ye, James, man, and show Mr. Storm to his room, and
      then find a bed for the creature somewhere. Letters for ye, laddie?
      Letters enough, and you&rsquo;ll find them on the table upstairs. Only, mind ye,
      the lunch is ready, and your fish is getting cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm opened his letters in his room. One of them was from his uncle,
      the Prime Minister: &ldquo;I rejoice to hear of your most sensible resolution.
      Come and dine with me at Downing Street this day week at seven o&rsquo;clock. I
      have much to say and much to ask, and I expect to be quite alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another was from his father: &ldquo;I am not surprised at your intelligence, but
      if anything could exceed the folly of going into a monastery it is the
      imbecility of coming out of it. The former appears to be a subject of
      common talk in this island already, and no doubt the latter will soon be
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John flinched as at a cut across the face and then smiled a smile of
      relief. Apparently Glory was writing home wherever she was, and there was
      good news in that, at all events. He went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come your way in, laddie, and let me look at ye again. Man, but your face
      is pale and your bonnie eyes are that sunken. But sit ye down and eat.
      They&rsquo;ve been starving ye, I&rsquo;m thinking, and miscalling it religion. It&rsquo;s
      enough to drive a reasonable body to drink. Carnal I am, laddie, and I
      just want to put some flesh on your bones. Monks indeed! And in this age
      of the world too! Little Jack Horners sitting in corners and saying, &lsquo;Oh,
      what a good boy am I!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John defended his late brethren. They were holy men; they lived a holy
      life; he had not been good enough for their company. &ldquo;But I feel like a
      sailor home from sea,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;tell me what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Births, marriages, and deaths? I suppose ye&rsquo;re like the lave of the men,
      and think nothing else matters to a woman. But come now, more chicken? No?
      A wee bitty? Aye, but ye&rsquo;re sair altered, laddie! Weel, where can a body
      begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The canon&mdash;how is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine as fi&rsquo;pence. Guid as ever in the pulpit? Aye, but it&rsquo;s a pity he
      doesna&rsquo; bide there, for he&rsquo;s naething to be windy of when he comes out of
      it. Deacon now, bless ye, or archdeacon, and some sic botherment, and his
      daughter is to be married to yon slip of a curate with the rabbit mouth
      and the heather legs. Weel, she wasna for all markets, ye ken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Macrae?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone over to the angels. Dead? Nae, ye&rsquo;re too expecting altogether. She&rsquo;s
      got religion though, and holds missionary meetings in her drawing-room of
      a Monday, and gives lunches to actor folk of a Sunday, and now a poor
      woman that&rsquo;s been working for charity and Christianity all her days has no
      chance with her anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miss Macrae?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor young leddy, they&rsquo;re for marrying her at last! Aye, to that Ure man,
      that lord thing with the eyeglass. I much misdoubt but her heart&rsquo;s been
      somewhere else, and there&rsquo;s ane auld woman would a hantle rather have
      heard tell of her getting the richt man than seeing the laddie bury hisel&rsquo; 
      in a monastery. She&rsquo;s given in at last though, and it&rsquo;s to be a grand
      wedding they&rsquo;re telling me. Your Americans are kittle cattle&mdash;just
      the Jews of the West seemingly, and they must do everything
      splendiferously. There are to be jewels as big as walnuts, and bouquets
      five feet in diameter, and a rope of pearls for a necklace, and a
      rehearsal of the hale thing in the church. Aye, indeed, a rehearsal, and
      the &lsquo;deacon, honest man, in the middle of the magnificence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s pale face was twitching. &ldquo;And the hospital,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has
      anything happened there&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other case such as the one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since yon poor bit lassie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the first ill thing I had heard tell of her for years, and the
      nurses are good women for all that. High-spirited? Aye; but dear, bright,
      happy things, to think what they have to know and to be present at!
      Lawyers, doctors, and nurses see the worst of human nature, and she&rsquo;d be a
      heartless woman who&rsquo;d no make allowances for them, poor creatures!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had risen from the table with a flushed face, making many
      excuses. He would step round to the hospital; he had questions to ask
      there, and it would be a walk after luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Callender, &ldquo;but remember dinner at six. And hark ye,
      hinny, this house is to be your hame until you light on a better one, so
      just sleep saft in it and wake merrily. And Jane Callender is to be your
      auld auntie until some ither body tak&rsquo;s ye frae her, and then it&rsquo;ll no be
      her hand ye&rsquo;ll be kissing for fear of her wrinkles, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day was bright, the sun was shining, and the streets were full of
      well-groomed horses in gorgeous carriages with coachmen in splendid
      liveries going to the drawing-room in honour of the royal birthday. As
      John went by the palace the approaches to it were thronged, the band of
      the Household Cavalry was playing within the rails, and officers in
      full-dress uniform, members of the diplomatic service with swords and
      cocked hats, and ladies in gorgeous brocades carrying bouquets of orchids
      and wearing tiaras of diamonds and large white plumes were filing through
      the gate toward the throne-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hospital looked strangely unfamiliar after so short an absence, and
      there were new faces among the nurses who passed to and fro in the
      corridors. John asked for the matron, and was received with constrained
      and distant courtesy. Was he well? Quite well. They had a resident
      chaplain now, and being in priest&rsquo;s orders he had many opportunities where
      death was so frequent. Was he sure he had not been ill? John understood&mdash;it
      was almost as if he had come out of some supernatural existence, and
      people looked at him as if they were afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to ask if you could tell me anything of Nurse Quayle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matron could tell him nothing. The girl had gone; they had been
      compelled to part with her. Nothing serious? No, but totally unfit to be a
      nurse. She had some good qualities certainly&mdash;cheerfulness,
      brightness, tenderness&mdash;and for the sake of these, and his own
      interest in the girl, they had put up with inconceivable rudeness and
      irregularities. What had become of her? She really could not say. Nurse
      Allworthy might know&mdash;and the matron took up her pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      John found the ward Sister with the house doctor at the bed of a patient.
      She was short, even curt, said over her shoulder she knew nothing about
      the girl, and then turned back to her work. As John passed out of the ward
      the doctor followed him and hinted that perhaps the porter might be able
      to tell him something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter was difficult at first, but seeing his way clearer after a
      while he admitted to receiving letters for the nurse and delivering them
      to her when she called. That was long ago, and she had not been there
      since New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Then she had given him a shilling and said she would
      trouble him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      John gave him five shillings and asked if anybody ever called for her.
      Yes, once. Who was it? A gentleman. Had he left his name? No, but he had
      said he would write. When was that? A day or two before she was there the
      last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake! There could not be a shadow of a doubt of it. John Storm looked at
      the clock. It was 3:45. Then he buttoned his coat and crossed the street
      to the park with his face in the direction of St. James&rsquo;s Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horatio Drake had given a luncheon in his rooms that day in honour of
      Glory&rsquo;s first public appearance. The performance was to come off at night,
      but in the course of the morning there had been a dress rehearsal in the
      <i>salon</i> of the music hall. Twenty men and women, chiefly journalists
      and artists, had assembled there to get a first glimpse of the <i>débutante</i>,
      and cameras had lurked behind <i>portières</i> and in alcoves to catch her
      poses, her expressions, her fleeting smiles, and humorous grimaces. Then
      the company had adjourned to Drake&rsquo;s chambers. The luncheon was now over,
      the last guest had gone, and the host was in his dining-room alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake was standing by the chimney-piece holding at arm&rsquo;s length a pencil
      sketch of a woman&rsquo;s beautiful face and lithe figure. &ldquo;Like herself&mdash;alive
      to the fingertips,&rdquo; he thought, and then he propped it against the
      pier-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of the opening and closing of the outer door downstairs,
      and Lord Robert entered the room. He looked heated, harassed, and
      exhausted. Shaking out his perfumed pocket handkerchief, he mopped his
      forehead, drew a long breath, and dropped into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polly Love had lunched with the company that day, and Lord Robert had
      returned home with her in order to break the news of his approaching
      marriage. While the girl had been removing her hat and jacket he had sat
      at the piano and thumbed it, hardly knowing how to begin. All at once he
      had said, &ldquo;Do you know, my dear, I&rsquo;m to be married on Saturday?&rdquo; She had
      said nothing at first, and he had played the piano furiously. Heavens,
      what a frame of mind to be in! Why didn&rsquo;t the girl speak? At last he had
      looked round at her, and there she stood grinning, gasping, and white as a
      ghost. Suddenly she had begun to cry. Good God, such crying! Yes, it was
      all over. Everything had been settled somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be in harder condition before I tackle such a job again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment. Drake was leaning on the mantelpiece, his
      legs crossed, and one foot beating on the hearth-rug. The men were
      ashamed, and they began to talk of indifferent things. Smoke? Didn&rsquo;t mind.
      Those Indian cigars were good. Not bad, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Drake said in a different voice, &ldquo;Cruel but necessary, Robert&mdash;necessary
      to the woman who is going to be your wife, cruel to the poor girl who has
      been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert rose to his feet impatiently, stretched his arm, and shot out
      his striped cuff and walked to and fro across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pon my soul, I believe I should have stuck to the little thing but for
      the old girl, don&rsquo;t you know. She&rsquo;s made such a good social running lately&mdash;and
      then she&rsquo;s started this evangelical craze too. No, Polly wouldn&rsquo;t have
      suited her book anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence again, and then further talk on indifferent things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish Benson wouldn&rsquo;t sweep the soda water off the table.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ring for it.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;The little thing really cares for me, don&rsquo;t you know. And it isn&rsquo;t my
      fault, is it? I had to hedge. Frank, dear boy, you&rsquo;re always taunting me
      with the treadmill we have to turn for the sake of society, and so forth,
      but with debts about a man&rsquo;s neck like a millstone, what could one do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re worse than others, old fellow, or that
      sacrificing this one poor child is going to mend matters much&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t likely to improve my style of going, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that man John Storm was not so far wrong, after all, and for this
      polygamy of our &lsquo;lavender-glove tribe&rsquo; the nation itself will be overtaken
      by the judgment of God one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert broke into a peal of derisive laughter. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Go
      on, dear boy! It&rsquo;s funny to hear you, though&mdash;after to-day&rsquo;s
      proceedings too&rdquo;; and he glanced significantly around the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake brought down his fist with a thump on to the mantelpiece. &ldquo;Hold your
      tongue, Robert! How often am I to tell you this is a different thing
      entirely? Because I discover a creature of genius and try to help her to
      the position she deserves&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hypocrite, if it had been a man instead of a charming little woman
      with big eyes, don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there had been a ring at the outer door, and Benson came in to say
      that a clergyman was waiting downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Golightly again!&rdquo; said Lord Robert wearily. &ldquo;Are these everlasting
      arrangements never&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man stopped him. It was not Mr. Golightly; it was a stranger; would
      not give his name; looked like a Catholic priest; had been there before,
      he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be&mdash;-Talk of the devil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him up,&rdquo; said Drake. And while Drake bit his lip and clinched his
      hands, and Lord Robert took up a scent bottle and sprayed himself with eau
      de cologne, they saw a man clad in the long coat of a priest come into the
      room&mdash;calm, grave, self-possessed, very pale, with hollow and shaven
      cheeks and dark and sunken eyes, which burned with a sombre fire, and head
      so closely cropped as to seem to be almost bald.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s anger had cooled. As he crossed the park the heat of his soul
      had turned to fear, and while he stood in the hall below, with an
      atmosphere of perfume about him, and even a delicate sense of a feminine
      presence, his fear had turned to terror. On that account he had refused to
      send up his name, and on going up the staircase, lined with prints, he had
      been tempted to turn about and fly lest he should come upon Glory face to
      face. But finding only the two men in the room above, his courage came
      back and he hated himself for his treacherous thought of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive me for this unceremonious visit, sir,&rdquo; he said,
      addressing himself to Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake motioned to him to be seated. He bowed, but continued to stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend will remember that I have been here before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert bent his head, and went on trifling with the spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a painful errand relating to a girl who had been nurse at the
      hospital. The girl was nothing to me, but she had a companion who was very
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake nodded and his lips stiffened, but he did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware that since then I have been away from the hospital. I wrote
      to you on the subject; you will remember that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only just returned, and have come direct from the hospital now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you know what I mean, sir. My young friend has gone. Can you tell
      me where to find her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry I can not,&rdquo; said Drake coldly, and it stung him to see a look of
      boundless relief cross the grave face in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said Drake, and then the lines of pain came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the request of her people I brought her up to London. Naturally they
      will look to me for news of her, and I feel responsible for her welfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is so, you must pardon me for saying you&rsquo;ve taken your duty
      lightly,&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm gripped the rail of the chair in front of him, and there was
      silence for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever I may have to blame myself with in the past, it would relieve me
      to find her well and happy and safe from all harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>is</i> well and happy, and safe too&mdash;I can tell you that
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another moment of silence, and then John Storm said in broken
      sentences and in a voice that was struggling to control itself: &ldquo;I have
      known her since she was a child, sir&mdash;-You can not think how many
      tender memories&mdash;-It is nearly a year since I saw her, and one likes
      to see old friends after an absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake did not speak, but he dropped his head, for John&rsquo;s eyes had begun to
      fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were good friends too. Boy and girl comrades almost. Brother and
      sister, I should say, for that was how I liked to think of myself&mdash;her
      elder brother bound to take care of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little trill of derisive laughter from the other side of the
      room, where Lord Robert had put the spray down noisily and turned to look
      out into the street. Then John Storm drew himself up and said in a firm
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, why should I mince matters? I will not do so. The girl we
      speak of is more to me than anybody else in the world besides. Perhaps she
      was one of the reasons why I went into that monastery. Certainly she is
      the reason I have come out of it. I have come to find her. I <i>shall</i>
      find her. If she is in difficulty or danger I intend to save her. Will you
      tell me where she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Storm,&rdquo; said Drake, &ldquo;I am sorry, very sorry, but what you say compels
      me to speak plainly. The lady is well and safe and happy. If her friends
      are anxious about her she can reassure them for herself, and no doubt she
      has already done so. But in the position she occupies at present you are a
      dangerous man. It might not be her wish, and it would not be to her
      advantage, to meet with you, and I can, not allow her to run the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it come to that? Have you a right to speak for her, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Drake hesitated, and then said with a rush,
      &ldquo;the right to protect her against a fanatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm curbed himself; he had been through a long schooling. &ldquo;Man, be
      honest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Either your interest is good or bad, selfish or
      unselfish. Which is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would be useless to bandy words. I didn&rsquo;t come here to do that.
      Will you tell me where she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is to be a duel between us&mdash;is that so? You for the girl&rsquo;s
      body and I for her soul? Very well, I take your challenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence once more, and John Storm&rsquo;s eyes wandered about the
      room. They fixed themselves at length on the sketch by the pier-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my former visit I met with the same reception. The girl could take
      care of herself. It was no business of mine. How that relation has ended I
      do not ask. But this one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one is an entirely different matter,&rdquo; said Drake, &ldquo;and I will thank
      you not to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John Storm was making the sign of the cross on his breast, and saying,
      as one who was uttering a prayer, &ldquo;God grant it is and always may be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment he was gone from the room. The two men stood where he
      had left them until his footsteps had ceased on the stairs and the door
      had closed behind him. Then Drake cried, &ldquo;Benson&mdash;a telegraph form! I
      must telegraph to Koenig at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;ll follow her up on the double quick,&rdquo; said Lord Robert. &ldquo;But
      what matter? His face will be enough to frighten the girl. Ugh! It was the
      face of a death&rsquo;s head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At dinner that night John Storm was more than usually silent. To break in
      upon his gravity, Mrs. Callender asked him what he intended to do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take priest&rsquo;s orders without delay,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, lifting a twitching and suffering face &ldquo;to make an attack
      on the one mighty stronghold of the devil&rsquo;s kingdom whereof woman is the
      direct and immediate victim; to tell Society over again it is an organized
      hypocrisy for the pursuit and demoralization of woman, and the Church that
      bachelorhood is not celibacy, and polygamy is against the laws of God; to
      look and search for the beaten and broken who lie scattered and astray in
      our bewildered cities, and to protect them and shelter them whatever they
      are, however low they have fallen, because they are my sisters and I love
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless ye, laddie! That&rsquo;s spoken like a man,&rdquo; said the old woman,
      rising from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But John Storm&rsquo;s pale face had already flushed up to the eyes, and he
      dropped his head as one who was ashamed.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock that night John Storm was walking through the streets of
      Soho. The bell of a jam factory had just been rung, and a stream of young
      girls in big hats with gorgeous flowers and sweeping feathers were pouring
      out of an archway and going arm-in-arm down the pavement. Men standing in
      groups at street ends shouted to them as they passed, and they shouted
      back in shrill voices and laughed with wild joy. In an alley round one
      corner an organ man was playing &ldquo;Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,&rdquo; and some of the
      girls began to dance and sing around him. Coming to the main artery of
      traffic, they were almost run down by a splendid equipage which was
      cutting across two thoroughfares into a square, and they screamed with
      mock terror as the fat coachman in tippet and cockade bellowed to them to
      get out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The square was a centre of gaiety. Theatres and music halls lined two of
      its sides, and the gas on their facades and the beacons on their roofs
      were beginning to burn brightly in the fading daylight. With skips and
      leaps the girls passed over to the doors of these palaces, and peered with
      greedy eyes through lines of policemen and doorkeepers in livery at
      gentlemen, in shields of shirt-front and ladies in light cloaks and long
      white gloves stepping out of gorgeous carriages into gorgeous halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was looking on at this masquerade when suddenly he became aware
      that the flare of coarse lights on the front of the building before him
      formed the letters of a word. The word was &ldquo;GLORIA.&rdquo; Seeing it again as he
      had seen it in the morning, but now identified and explained, he grew hot
      and cold by turns, and his brain, which refused to think, felt like a sail
      that is flapping idly on the edge of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a garden in the middle of the square, and he walked round and
      round it. He gazed vacantly at a statue in the middle of the garden, and
      then walked round the rails again. The darkness was gathering fast, the
      gas was beginning to blaze, and he was like a creature in the coil of a
      horrible fascination. That word, that name over the music hall, fizzing
      and crackling in its hundred lights, seemed to hold him as by an eye of
      fire. And remembering what had happened since he left the monastery&mdash;the
      sandwich men, the boards on the omnibuses, the hoardings on the walls&mdash;it
      seemed like a fiery finger which had led him to that spot. Only one thing
      was clear&mdash;that a supernatural power had brought him there, and that
      it was intended he should come. Fearfully, shamefully, miserably, rebuking
      himself for his doubts, yet conquered and compelled by them, he crossed
      the street and entered the music hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in the pit and it was crowded; not a seat vacant anywhere, and many
      persons standing packed in the crush-room at the back. His first sensation
      was of being stared at. First the man at the pay-box and then the
      check-taker had looked at him, and now he was being looked at by the
      people about him. They were both men and girls. Some of the men wore light
      frock-coats and talked in the slang of the race-course, some of the girls
      wore noticeable hats and showy flowers in their bosoms and were laughing
      in loud voices. They made a way for him of themselves, and he passed
      through to a wooden barrier that ran round the last of the pit seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music hall was large, and to John Storm&rsquo;s eyes, straight from the
      poverty of his cell, it seemed garish in the red and gold of its Eastern
      decorations. Men in the pit seats were smoking pipes and cigarettes, and
      waiters with trays were hurrying up and down the aisles serving ale and
      porter, which they set down on ledges like the book-rests in church. In
      the stalls in front, which were not so full, gentlemen in evening dress
      were smoking cigars, and there was an arc of the tier above, in which
      people in fashionable costumes were talking audibly. Higher yet, and
      unseen from that position, there was a larger audience still, whose voices
      rumbled like a distant sea. A cloud of smoke filled the atmosphere, and
      from time to time there was the sound of popping corks and breaking
      glasses and rolling bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain was down, but the orchestra was beginning to play. Two men in
      livery came from the sides of the curtain and fixed up large figures in
      picture frames that were attached to the wings of the proscenium. Then the
      curtain rose and the entertainment was resumed. It was in sections, and
      after each performance the curtain was dropped and the waiters went round
      with their trays again.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had seen it all before in the days when, under his father&rsquo;s
      guidance, he had seen everything&mdash;the juggler, the acrobat, the
      step-dancer, the comic singer, the tableaus, and the living picture. He
      felt tired and ashamed, yet, he could not bring himself to go away. As the
      evening advanced he thought: &ldquo;How foolish! What madness it was to think of
      such a thing!&rdquo; He was easier after that, and began to listen to the talk
      of the people about him. It was free, but not offensive. In the frequent
      intervals some of the men played with the girls, pushing and nudging and
      joking with them, and the girls laughed and answered back. Occasionally
      one of them would turn her head aside and look into John&rsquo;s face with a
      saucy smile. &ldquo;God forbid that I should grudge them their pleasure!&rdquo; he
      thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all they have, poor creatures!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the audience grew noisier as the evening went on. They called to the
      singers, made inarticulate squeals, and then laughed at their own humour.
      A lady sang a comic song. It described her attempt to climb to the top of
      an omnibus on a windy day. John turned to look at the faces behind him,
      and every face was red and hot, and grinning and grimacing. He was still
      half buried in the monastery he had left that morning, and he thought:
      &ldquo;Such are the nightly pleasures of our people. To-night, to-morrow night,
      the night after! O my country, my country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was awakened from these thoughts by an outburst of applause. The
      curtain was down and nothing was going on except the putting up of a new
      figure in the frames. The figure was 8. Some one behind him said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      her number!&rdquo; &ldquo;The new artiste?&rdquo; said another voice. &ldquo;Gloria,&rdquo; said the
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s head began to swim. He looked back&mdash;he was in a solid
      block of people. &ldquo;After all, what reasons have I?&rdquo; he thought, and he
      determined to stand his ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      More applause. Another leader of the orchestra had appeared. <i>Bâton</i>
      in hand, he was bowing from his place before the footlights. It was
      Koenig, the organist, and John Storm shuddered in the darkest corner of
      his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stalls had filled up unawares to him, and a party was now coming into
      a private box which had hitherto been empty. The late-comers were Drake
      and Lord Robert Ure, and a lady with short hair brushed back from her
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm felt the place going round him, yet he steadied and braced
      himself. &ldquo;But this is the natural atmosphere of such people,&rdquo; he thought.
      He tried to find satisfaction in the thought that Glory was not with them.
      Perhaps they had exaggerated their intimacy with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band began to play. It was music for the entrance of a new performer.
      The audience became quiet; there was a keen, eager, expectant air; and
      then the curtain went up. John Storm felt dizzy. If he could have escaped
      he would have turned and fled. He gripped with both hands the rail in
      front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a woman came gliding on to the stage. She was a tall girl in a dark
      dress and long black gloves, with red hair, and a head like a rose. It was
      Glory! A cloud came over John Storm&rsquo;s eyes, and for a few moments he saw
      no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some applause from the pit and the regions overhead. The people
      in the stalls were waving their handkerchiefs, and the lady in the box was
      kissing her hand. Glory was smiling, quite at her ease, apparently not at
      all nervous, only a little shy and with her hands interlaced in front of
      her. Then there was silence again and she began to sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the moment when prayers go up from the heart not used to pray.
      Strange contradiction! John Storm found himself praying that Glory might
      do well, that she might succeed and eclipse everything! But he had turned
      his eyes away, and the sound of her voice was even more afflicting than
      the sight of her face. It was nearly a year since he had heard it last,
      and now he was hearing it under these conditions, in a place like this! He
      must have been making noises by his breathing. &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; said the
      people about him, and somebody tapped him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment he regained control of himself, and he lifted his head and
      listened. Glory&rsquo;s voice, which had been quavering at first, gathered
      strength. She was singing Mylecharaine, and the wild, plaintive harmony of
      the old Manx ballad was floating in the air like the sound of the sea.
      After her first lines a murmur of approval went round, the people sat up
      and leaned forward, and then there was silence again&mdash;dead silence&mdash;and
      then loud applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was only with the second verse that the humour of her song began,
      and John Storm waited for it with a trembling heart. He had heard her sing
      it a hundred times in the old days, and she was singing it now as she had
      sung it before. There were the same tricks of voice, the same tricks of
      gesture, the same expressions, the same grimaces. Everything was the same,
      and yet everything was changed. He knew it. He was sure it must be so. So
      artless and innocent then, now so subtle and significant! Where was the
      difference? The difference was in the place, in the people. John Storm
      could have found it in his heart to turn on the audience and insult them.
      Foul-minded creatures, laughing, screaming, squealing, punctuating their
      own base interpretations and making evil of what was harmless! How he
      hated the grinning faces round about him!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the song was finished Glory swept a gay courtesy, lifted her skirts,
      and tripped off the stage. Then there were shouting, whistling, stamping,
      and deafening applause. The whole house was unanimous for an encore, and
      she came back smiling and bowing with a certain look of elation and pride.
      John Storm was becoming terrified by his own anger. &ldquo;Be quiet there!&rdquo; said
      some one behind him. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the josser?&rdquo; said somebody else, and then he
      heard Glory&rsquo;s voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was another Manx ditty. A crew of young fishermen are going ashore on
      Saturday night after their week on the sea after the herring. They go up
      to the inn; their sweethearts meet them there; they drink and sing. At
      length they are so overcome by liquor and love that they have to be put to
      bed in their big sea boots. Then the girls kiss them and leave them. The
      singer imitated the kissing, and the delighted audience repeated the
      sound. Sounds of kissing came from all parts of the hall, mingled with
      loud acclamations of laughter. The singer smiled and kissed back. Somehow
      she conveyed the sense of a confidential feeling as if she were doing it
      for each separate person in the audience, and each person had an impulse
      to respond. It was irresistible, it was maddening, it swept over the whole
      house.
    </p>

      John Storm felt sick in his very soul. Glory knew well what she was doing.
      She knew what these people wanted. His Glory! Glory of the old, innocent
      happy days! O God! O God! If he could only get out! But that was
      impossible. Behind him the dense mass was denser than ever, and he was
      tightly wedged in by a wall of faces&mdash;hot, eager, with open mouths,
      teeth showing, and glittering and dancing eyes. He tried not to listen to
      what the people about were saying, yet he could not help but hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tasty, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; &ldquo;Cerulean, eh?&rdquo; &ldquo;Bit &lsquo;ot, certinly!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, if I was a
      Johnny, and had got the oof, she&rsquo;d have a brougham and a sealskin
      to-morrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;To-night, you mean,&rdquo; and then there were significant squeaks
      and trills of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called her back again, and yet again, and she returned with
      unaffected cheerfulness and a certain look of triumph. At one moment she
      was doing the gaiety of youth, and at the next the crabbedness of age; now
      the undeveloped femininity of the young girl, then the volubility of the
      old woman. But John Storm was trying to hear none of it. With his head in
      his breast and his eyes down he was struggling to think of the monastery,
      and to imagine that he was still buried in his cell. It was only this
      morning that he left it, yet it seemed to be a hundred years ago. Last
      night the Brotherhood, the singing of Evensong, Compline, the pure air,
      silence, solitude, and the atmosphere of prayer; and to-night the crowds,
      the clouds of smoke, the odour of drink, the meaning laughter, and Glory
      as the centre of it all!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment everything was blotted out, and then there was loud
      hand-clapping and cries of &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; He lifted his head. Glory had finished
      and was bowing herself off. The lady in the private box flung her a
      bouquet of damask roses. She picked it up and kissed it, and bowed to the
      box, and then the acclamations of applause were renewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crush behind relaxed a little, and he began to elbow his way out.
      People were rising or stirring everywhere, and the house was emptying
      fast. As the audience surged down the corridors to the doors they talked
      and laughed and made inarticulate sounds. &ldquo;A tricky bit o&rsquo; muslin, eh?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Yus, she&rsquo;s thick.&rdquo; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my dart, anyhow.&rdquo; Then the whistling of a tune.
      It was the chorus of Mylecharaine. John Storm felt the cool air of the
      street on his hot face at last. The policemen were keeping a way for the
      people coming from the stalls, the doorkeepers were whistling or shouting
      for cabs, and their cries were being caught up by the match boys, who were
      running in and out like dogs among the carriage wheels and the horses&rsquo; 
      feet. &ldquo;En-sim!&rdquo; &ldquo;Four-wheel-er!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a narrow court at the back, dimly lit and not much frequented, there
      was a small open door under a lamp suspended from a high blank wall. This
      was the stage-door of the music hall, and a group of young men, looking
      like hairdressers&rsquo; assistants, blocked the pavement at either side of it.
      &ldquo;Wonder what she&rsquo;s like off?&rdquo; &ldquo;Like a laidy, you bet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yus, but none o&rsquo; 
      yer bloomin&rsquo; hamatoors.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gawd, here&rsquo;s the josser again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm pushed his way through to where a commissionaire sat behind a
      glass partition in a little room walled with pigeon holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see Miss Quayle?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter looked blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gloria, then,&rdquo; said John Storm, with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter looked at him suspiciously. Had he an appointment? No; but
      could he send in his name? The porter looked doubtful. Would she come out
      soon? The porter did not know. Would she come this way? The porter could
      not tell. Could he have her address?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye want to write to the laidy, write here,&rdquo; said the porter, with a
      motion of his hands to the pigeon-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm felt humiliated and ashamed. The hairdressers&rsquo; assistants were
      grinning at him. He went out, feeling that Glory was farther than ever
      from him now, and if he met her they might not speak. But he could not
      drag himself away. In the darkness under a lamp at the other side of the
      street he stood and waited. Shoddy broughams drove up, with drivers in
      shabby livery, bringing &ldquo;turns&rdquo; in wonderful hats and overcoats, over
      impossible wigs, whiskers, and noses&mdash;niggers, acrobats, clowns, and
      comic singers, who stepped out, shook the straw of their carriage carpets
      off their legs, and passed in at the stage entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the commissionaire appeared at the door and whistled, and a
      hansom cab rattled up to the end of the court. Then a lady muffled in a
      cape, with the hood drawn over her head, and carrying a bouquet of roses,
      came out leaning on the arm of a gentleman. She stood a moment by his side
      and spoke to him and laughed. John heard her laughter. At the next moment
      she had stepped into the hansom, the door had fallen to, the driver had
      turned, the gentleman had raised his hat, the light had fallen on the
      lady&rsquo;s face, and she was leaning forward and smiling. John saw her smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment the hansom had passed into the illuminated
      thoroughfares and the group of people had dispersed. John Storm was alone
      under the lamp in the little dark street, and somewhere in the dark alleys
      behind him the organ man was still grinding out &ldquo;Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, what luck on your first night out?&rdquo; said Mrs. Callender at
      breakfast in the morning. &ldquo;Found any of the poor lost things yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One,&rdquo; said John, with a rueful face. &ldquo;Lost enough, though she doesn&rsquo;t
      know it yet, God help her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never do at first, laddie. Write to her friends, if she has any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like home influences, ye ken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;I must! It&rsquo;s all I can do now.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;The Priory, Friday Morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear aunties, don&rsquo;t be terrified, but Glory has had a kind of a
      wee big triumph! Nothing very awful, you know, but on Monday night, before
      a rather larger company than usual, she sang and recited and play-acted a
      little, and as a result all the earth&mdash;the London earth&mdash;is
      talking about her, and nobody is taking any notice of the rest of the
      world. Every post is bringing me flowers with ribbons and cards attached,
      or illustrated weeklies with my picture and my life in little, and I find
      it&rsquo;s wonderful what a lot of things you may learn about yourself if you&rsquo;ll
      only read the papers. My room at this moment is like a florist&rsquo;s window at
      nine o&rsquo;clock on Saturday morning, and I have reason to suspect that mine
      host and teacher, Carl Koenig, F. E. C. O., exhibits them to admiring
      neighbours when I am out. The voice of that dear old turtle has ever since
      Monday been heard in the land, and besides telling me about Poland day and
      night from all the subterranean passages of the house, he has taken to
      waiting on me like a nigger, and ordering soups and jellies for me as if I
      had suddenly become an invalid. Of course, I am an able-bodied woman just
      the same as ever, but my nerves have been on the rack all the week, and I
      feel exactly as I did long ago at Peel when I was a little naughty minx
      and got up into the tower of the old church and began pulling at the bell
      rope, you remember. Oh, dear! oh, dear! My frantic terror at the noise of
      the big bells and the vibration of the shaky old walls! Once I had begun I
      couldn&rsquo;t leave off for my life, but went on tugging and tugging and
      quaking and quaking until&mdash;have you forgotten it?&mdash;all the
      people came running helter-skelter under the impression that the town was
      afire. And then, behold, it was only little me, trembling like a leaf and
      crying like a ninny! I remember I was scolded and smacked and dismissed
      into outer darkness (it was the chip vault, I think), for that first
      outbreak of fame, and now, lest you should want to mete out the same
      punishment to me again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Anna, I&rsquo;m knitting the sweetest little shawl for you, dear&mdash;blue
      and white, to suit your complexion&mdash;being engaged in the evening
      only, and most of the day sole mistress of my own will and pleasure. How
      charming of me, isn&rsquo;t it? But I&rsquo;m afraid it isn&rsquo;t, because you&rsquo;ll see
      through me like a colander, for I want to tell you something which I have
      kept back too long, and when I think of it I grow old and wrinkled like a
      Christmas apple. So you must be a pair of absolute old angels, aunties,
      and break the news to grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I told you, Aunt Rachel, to say something for me at nine o&rsquo;clock
      on the Queen&rsquo;s birthday. And you remember that Mr. Drake used to think
      pearls and diamonds of Glory, and predict wonderful things for her. Then
      you don&rsquo;t forget that Mr. Drake had a friend named Lord Robert Ure,
      commonly called Lord Bob. Well, you see, by Mr. Drake&rsquo;s advice, and Lord
      Bobbie&rsquo;s influence and agency, and I don&rsquo;t know what, I have made one more
      change&mdash;it&rsquo;s to be the last, dears, the very last&mdash;in my
      Wandering-Jew existence, and now I am no longer a society entertainer,
      because I am a music-hall art&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory had written so far when she dropped the pen and rose from the table,
      wiping her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child, you can&rsquo;t tell them, it&rsquo;s impossible; they would never
      forgive you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a carriage stopped before the house, the garden bell was rung, and
      the maid came into the room with a lady&rsquo;s card. It was inscribed &ldquo;Miss
      Polly Love,&rdquo; with many splashes and flourishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask her up,&rdquo; said Glory. And then Polly came rustling up the stairs in a
      silver-gray silk dress and a noticeable hat, and with a pug-dog tucked
      under her arm. She looked older and less beautiful. The pink and ivory of
      her cheeks was coated with powder, and her light gray eyes were pencilled.
      There was the same blemished appearance as before, and the crack in the
      vase was now plainly visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory had met the girl only once since they parted after the hospital, but
      Polly kissed her effusively. Then she sat down and began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t think it, my dear, but I&rsquo;m the most miserable girl
      in London. Haven&rsquo;t you heard about it? I thought everybody knew. Robert is
      going to be married. Yes, indeed, to-morrow morning to that American
      heiress, and I hadn&rsquo;t an idea of it until Monday afternoon. That was the
      day of your luncheon, dear, and I felt sure something was going to happen,
      because I broke my looking-glass dressing to go out. Robert took me home,
      and he began to play the piano, and I could see he was going to say
      something. &lsquo;Do you know, little woman, I&rsquo;m to be married on Saturday?&rsquo; I
      wonder I didn&rsquo;t drop, but I didn&rsquo;t, and he went on playing. But it was no
      use trying, and I burst out and ran into my room. After a minute I heard
      him coming in, but he didn&rsquo;t lift me up as he used to do. Only talked to
      me over my back, telling me to control myself, and what he was going to do
      for me, and so on. He used to say a few tears made me nicer looking, but
      it was no good crying&mdash;and then he went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to cry again, and the dog in her lap began to howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done to be so unfortunate. I&rsquo;ve not been
      flash at all, and I never went to <i>cafés</i> at night, or to Sally&rsquo;s or
      Kate&rsquo;s, as so many girls do, and he can&rsquo;t say I ever took notice of
      anybody else. When I love anybody I think of him last thing at night and
      first thing in the morning, and now to be left alone&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I
      shall never live through it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory tried to comfort the poor broken creature. It was her duty to live.
      There was her child&mdash;had she never even seen it since she parted with
      it to Mrs. Jupe? It must be such a darling by this time, creeping about
      and talking a little, wherever it was. She ought to have the child to live
      with her, it would be such company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly kissed the pug to stop its whining, and said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want company.
      Life isn&rsquo;t the same thing to me now. He thinks because he is marrying that
      woman&mdash;What better is she than me, I would like to know? She&rsquo;s only
      snapping at him for what he is, and he is only taking her for what she&rsquo;s
      got, and I&rsquo;ve a great mind to go to All Saints&rsquo; and shame them. You
      wouldn&rsquo;t? Well, it&rsquo;s hard to hide one&rsquo;s feelings, but it would serve them
      right if&mdash;if I did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polly had risen with a wild look, and was pressing the pug so hard that it
      was howling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did what?&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;that is to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t dream of going to the church. The police&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t the police I&rsquo;m afraid of,&rdquo; said Polly, tossing her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, my dear,&rdquo; said Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way downstairs she reproached herself for not seeing what was
      coming. &ldquo;But girls like us never do, now do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory coloured up to her hair, but made no protest. At the gate Polly
      wiped her eyes and drew down her veil, and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say it to
      your face, my dear, but it&rsquo;s all been that Mr. Drake&rsquo;s doings, and a girl
      ought to know he&rsquo;d do as much himself, and worse. But you&rsquo;re a great woman
      now, and in everybody&rsquo;s mouth, so you needn&rsquo;t care. Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s face was scarlet and her under lip was bleeding. Yet she kissed
      the poor shallow thing at parting, because she was down, and did not
      understand, and lived in another world entirely. But going back to where
      her letter lay unfinished she thought: &ldquo;Impossible! If this girl, living
      in an atmosphere so different, thinks that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Then she sat at
      the table and forced herself to tell all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had got through the red riot of her confession and was writing: &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know what he would think of it, but do you know I thought I saw his
      face on Wednesday night. It was in the dark, and I was in a cab driving
      away from the stage door. But so changed! oh, so changed! It must have
      been a dream, and it was the same as if his ghost had passed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she became aware of voices in dispute downstairs. First a man&rsquo;s
      voice, then the voices of two men&mdash;one of them Koenig&rsquo;s, the other
      with a haunting ring in it. She got up from the table and went to the door
      of her room, going on tip-toe, yet hardly knowing why. Koenig was saying:
      &ldquo;No, sair, de lady does not lif here.&rdquo; Then a deep, strong chest-voice
      answered, &ldquo;Mr. Koenig, surely you remember me?&rdquo; and Glory&rsquo;s heart seemed
      to beat like a watch. &ldquo;No-o, sair. Are you&mdash;Oh, yes; what am I
      thinking of?&mdash;But de lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Koenig,&rdquo; Glory called, cried, gasped over the stair-rail, &ldquo;ask the
      gentleman to come up, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hardly knew what happened next, only that Koenig seemed to be
      muttering confused explanations below, and that she was back in her
      sitting-room giving a glance into the looking-glass and doing something
      with her hair. Then there was a step on the stairs, on the landing, at the
      threshold, and she fell back a few paces from the door, that she might see
      him as he came in. He knocked. Her heart was beating so violently that she
      had to keep her hand over it. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she saw him coming down on her, and the very sunlight seemed to wave
      like the shadows on a ship. He was paler and thinner, his great eyes
      looked weary though they smiled, his hand felt bony though firm, and his
      head was closely cropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for a moment without speaking and with a sensation of
      fulness at her heart that was almost choking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you? I didn&rsquo;t know it was you&mdash;I was just thinking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       She was talking at random, and was out of breath as if she had been
      running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory, I have frightened you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightened? Oh, no! Why should you think so? Perhaps I am crying, but
      then I&rsquo;m always doing that nowadays. And, besides, you are so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am altered,&rdquo; he said in the pause that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are altered too.&rdquo; He was looking at her with an earnest and
      passionate gaze. It was she&mdash;herself&mdash;Glory&mdash;not merely a
      vision or a dream. Again he recognised the glorious eyes with their
      brilliant lashes and the flashing spot in one of them that had so often
      set his heart beating. She looked back at him and thought, &ldquo;How ill he
      must have been!&rdquo; and then a lump came into her throat and she began to
      laugh that she might not have to cry, and broke out into broad Manx lest
      he should hear the tremor in her voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re coming too, aren&rsquo;t ye? And you&rsquo;ve left that theer&mdash;Aw,
      it&rsquo;s glad ter&rsquo;ble I am, as our people say, and it&rsquo;s longin&rsquo; mortal you&rsquo;d
      be for all, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another trill of nervous laughter, and then a burst of earnest English:
      &ldquo;But tell me, you&rsquo;ve come for good&mdash;you are not going back to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not going back to the Brotherhood, Glory.&rdquo; How friendly his low
      voice sounded!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve left the hospital, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; he said. His weary eyes were wandering about the room, and
      for the first time she felt ashamed of its luxuries and its flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you find me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the hospital first&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you hadn&rsquo;t forgotten me? Do you know I thought you had quite&mdash;But
      tell me at once, where did you go then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment, and she said, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I went to Mr. Drake&rsquo;s chambers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why everybody should think that Mr. Drake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His great eyes were fixed on her face and his mouth was quivering, and, to
      prevent him from speaking, she put on a look of forced gaiety and said,
      &ldquo;But how did you light on me at last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to find you, Glory, if I tramped all London over and everybody
      denied you to me&rdquo;&mdash;the lump in her throat was hurting her dreadfully&mdash;&ldquo;but
      I chanced to see the name over the music hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw it coming, and broke into laughter. &ldquo;The music hall! Only think!
      You looking at music halls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there on Monday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? Monday? Then perhaps it was not my fancy that I saw you by the stage
      do&mdash;.&rdquo; Her nerves were getting more and more excited, and to calm
      them she crossed her arms above her head. &ldquo;So they gave you my address at
      the stage door, did they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wrote for it to Peel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peel?&rdquo; She caught her breath, and her arms came down. &ldquo;Then perhaps you
      told them where&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;I told them nothing, Glory.&rdquo; She looked at
      him through her eyelashes, her head held down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that it matters, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been writing to them, and they&rsquo;ll soon&mdash;But, oh, I&rsquo;ve so
      much to say, and I can&rsquo;t say it here. Couldn&rsquo;t we go somewhere? Into the
      park or on to the heath, or farther&mdash;much farther&mdash;the room is
      so small, and I feel as if I&rsquo;ve been suffocating for want of air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something to say too, and if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let it be to-morrow morning, and we&rsquo;ll start early, and you&rsquo;ll bring
      me back in time for the theatre. Say Paddington Station, at eleven&mdash;will
      that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw him to the gate, and when he was going she wanted him to kiss her
      hand, so she pretended to do the high handshake, but he only held it for a
      moment and looked steadily into her eyes. The sunshine was pouring into
      the garden, and she was bareheaded. Her hair was coiled up, and she was
      wearing a light morning blouse. He thought she had never looked so
      beautiful. On getting into the omnibus at the end of the street he took a
      letter out of his vest pocket, and, being alone, he first carried it to
      his lips, then reopened and read it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See her at once, dear John, and keep in touch with her, and I shall be
      happy and relieved. As for your father, that old Chaise is going crazy and
      is sending Lord Storm crazy too. He has actually discovered that the dust
      the witch walks on who has cast the evil eye on you lies in front of
      Glenfaba gate, and he has been sweeping it up o&rsquo; nights and scattering it
      in front of Knockaloe! What simplicity! There are only two women here.
      Does the silly old gawk mean Rachel? or is it, perhaps, Aunt Anna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while the omnibus joggled down the street, and the pale young
      clergyman with the great weary eyes was poring over his letter, Glory was
      sitting at her table and writing with flying fingers and a look of
      enthusiastic ecstasy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had three bites at this cherry. But who do you think has just been
      here? John!&mdash;John Storm! But then you know that he is back, and it
      wasn&rsquo;t merely my fancy that I saw him by the stage door. It seems as if
      people have been denying me to him, and he has been waiting for me and
      watching over me.&rdquo; (Blot.) &ldquo;His voice is so low, but I suppose that comes
      to people who are much alone, and he is so thin and so pale, and his eyes
      are so large, and they have that deep look that cuts into the heart. He
      knew he was changed, and I think he was ashamed&rdquo; (blot), &ldquo;but of course I
      didn&rsquo;t let whit that I was taking notice, and I&rsquo;m so happy for his sake,
      poor fellow! that he has escaped from his cage in that Salvation zoo that
      I know I shall make them split their sides in the theatre to-night.&rdquo;
       (Blot, blot.) &ldquo;How tiresome! This ink must have got water in it somehow,
      and then my handwriting is such a hop-skip-and-a-jump anyway. But hoots!
    </p>

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful May morning, and standing by the Paddington Station
      with the dog at his feet, he felt her approach instinctively as she came
      toward him with her free step in her white cambric dress under the light
      parasol fringed with lace. Her face was glowing with the fresh air, and
      she looked happy and bright. As they walked into the station she poured
      out a stream of questions about the dog, took possession of him
      straightway, and concluded to call him Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      They agreed to spend the day at Burnham Beeches, and while he went for the
      tickets she stepped on to the platform. It was Saturday, the bookstall was
      ablaze with the picture papers, and one of them was prominently displayed
      at a page containing her own portrait. She wanted John to see this, so she
      invented an excuse for bringing him face to face with it, and then she
      laughed and he bought the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk recognised her&mdash;they could see that by the smile he kept in
      reserve&mdash;and a group of officers in the Guards, in flannels and straw
      hats, going down to their club at Maidenhead, looked at her and nudged
      each other as if they knew who she was. Her eyes danced, her lips smiled,
      and she was proud that John should see the first fruits of her fame. She
      was proud of him, too, with his bold walk and strong carriage, as they
      passed the officers in their negligent dress, with their red and blue
      neckties. But John&rsquo;s heart was aching, and he was wondering how he was to
      begin on the duty he had to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment they started she gave herself up to the delights of their
      holiday, and even the groaning and cranking and joggling of the train
      amused her. When the Guards had got into their first-class carriage they
      had glanced at the open window where her brilliant eyes and rosy lips were
      gleaming behind a veil. John gazed at her with his slow and tender looks,
      and felt guilty and ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the train at Slough, and a wave of freshness, with an odour of
      verdure and sap, blew into their faces. The dog leaped and barked, and
      Glory skipped along with it, breaking every moment into enthusiastic
      exclamations. There was hardly any wind, and the clouds, which were very
      high overhead, were scarcely moving. It was a glorious day, and Glory&rsquo;s
      face wore an expression of perfect happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lunched at the old hotel in the town, with the window open, and the
      swallows darting in the air outside, and Glory, who took milk &ldquo;for
      remembrance,&rdquo; rose and said, &ldquo;I looks toward Mr. Storm,&rdquo; and then drank
      his health and swept him the prettiest courtesy. All through lunch she
      kept feeding the dog from her own fingers, and at the end rebuked him for
      spreading his bones in a half circle across the carpet, a thing which was
      never done, she said, in the best society, this side the Cannibal Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-and-bye,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;time enough by-and-bye,&rdquo; for the charm of her
      joy was infectious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was high when they started on their walk, and her face looked
      flushed and warm. But through the park-like district to the wood she raced
      with Don, and made him leap over her sunshade and roll over and over on
      the bright green grass. The larks were trilling overhead, everything was
      humming and singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her have one happy day,&rdquo; he thought, and they began to call and shout
      to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they came to the beeches, and, being sheltered from the fiery rays of
      the sun, she put down her sunshade and John took off his hat. The silence
      and gloom, the great gnarled trees, with their thews and sinews, their
      arms and thighs and loins, the gentle rustle of the breeze in the branches
      overhead, the deep accumulation of dead leaves underfoot, the fluttering
      of wings, the low cooing of pigeons, and all the mystery and wonder of the
      wood, brought a sense of awe, as on entering a mighty minster in the dusk.
      But this wore away presently, and Glory began to sing. Her pure voice
      echoed in the fragrant air, and the happiness so long pent up and starved
      seemed to bubble in every word and note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this better than singing in music halls?&rdquo; he thought, and then he
      began to sing too, just like any happy boy, without thinking of yesterday
      or to-morrow, of before or after. She smiled at him. He smiled back. It
      was like a dream. After his long seclusion it was difficult to believe it
      could be true. The open air, the perfume of the leaves they were wading
      through, the silver bark of the birches and the blue peeps of the sky
      between, and then Glory walking with her graceful motion, and laughing and
      singing by his side! &ldquo;I shall wake up in a minute,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
      I shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sang one song together. It was Lasses and Lads, and to make
      themselves think it was the old time back again they took each other&rsquo;s
      hands and swung them to the tune. He felt her clasp like milk coursing
      through his body, and a great wave of tenderness swept up his hard resolve
      as sea-wrack is thrown up after a storm. &ldquo;She is here; we are together;
      why trouble about anything more?&rdquo; and the time flew by.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their voices went wrong immediately, and they were soon in
      difficulties. Then she laughed, and they began again; but they could not
      keep together, and as often as they tried they failed. &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s not like
      the old days!&rdquo; he thought, and a mood of sadness came over him. He had
      begun to observe in Glory the trace of the life she had passed through&mdash;words,
      phrases, ideas, snatches of slang, touches of moods which had the note of
      a slight vulgarity. When the dog took a bone uninvited she cried: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      click; you&rsquo;ve sneaked it&rdquo;; when John broke down in the singing she told
      him to &ldquo;chuck it off the chest&rdquo;; and when he stopped altogether she called
      him glum, and said she would &ldquo;do it on her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he look so sorrowful?&rdquo; she thought, and telling herself that
      this came to people who were much alone, she rattled on more recklessly
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked of the life of the music hall, the life at &ldquo;the back,&rdquo;
       glorifying it by a tone of apology. It was all hurry-scurry, slap, dash,
      and drive; no time to consider effects; a succession of last acts and
      first nights; so it was really harder to be a music-hall woman than a
      regular actress. And the music-hall woman was no worse than other women&mdash;considering.
      Had he seen their ballet? It was fetching. Such pages! Simply darlings! <i>They</i>
      were the proud young birds of paradise whom toffs like those Guards came
      to see, and it was fun to see them pluming and preening themselves at the
      back, each for the eyes of her own particular lord in the stalls. Thus she
      flung out unfamiliar notes, hardly knowing their purport, but to John they
      were as slimy creatures out of the social mire she had struggled through.
      O London! London! Its shadow was over them even there, and go where they
      would, they could never escape from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His former thought began to hang about him again, and he asked her to tell
      him what had happened to her during his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, I brought three golden sovereigns out of the
      hospital to distribute among the people of London, but, bless you, they
      went nowhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then Hope was a good breakfast but a bad supper, you know. But
      shall I tell you all? Yes, yes, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him of Mrs. Jupe, and of the deception she had practised upon her
      people, and he turned his head that he might not see her tears. She told
      him of the &ldquo;Three Graces,&rdquo; and of the stage manager&mdash;she called him
      the &ldquo;stage damager&rdquo;&mdash;and then <i>she</i> turned her head that she
      might hide her shame. She told him of Josephs, the bogus agent, and his
      face grew hard and his brown eyes looked black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did you say his place was?&rdquo; he asked in a voice that vibrated
      and broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; she answered with a laugh and a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him of Aggie, and of the foreign clubs, and of Koenig, and of the
      dinner party at the Home Secretary&rsquo;s, and then she skipped a step and
      cried:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ding, dong, dended,
  My tale&rsquo;s ended.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was it there you met Mr. Drake again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replied with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never having seen him in the meantime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pursed her lips and shook her head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all over now, and what
      matter? I likes to be jolly and I allwis is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it all over?&rdquo; he said, and he looked at her again with the deep
      look that had cut into her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to say something,&rdquo; she thought, and she began to laugh, but
      with a faint tremor, and giving the dog her parasol to carry in his mouth,
      she took off her hat, swung it in her hand by the brim, and set off to
      run.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the light shimmer of a pool at a level below, where the water
      had drained to a bottom and was inclosed by beeches. The trees seemed to
      hang over it with outstretched wings, like birds about to alight, and
      round its banks there were plots of violets which filled the air with
      their fragrance. It was a God-blest bit of ground, and when he came up
      with her she was standing at the edge of the marshy mere panting and on
      the point of tears, and saying, in a whisper, &ldquo;Oh, how beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But however am I to get across?&rdquo; she cried, looking with mock terror on
      the two inches of water that barely covered the grass, and at the pretty
      red shoes that peeped from under her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something extraordinary occurred. She hardly knew what was happening
      until it was over. Without a word, without a smile, he lifted her up in
      his arms and carried her to the other side. She felt helpless like a
      child, as if suddenly she belonged to herself no longer. Her head had
      fallen on his shoulder and her heart was beating against his breast. Or
      was it <i>his</i> heart that was beating? When he put her down she was
      afraid she was going to cry, so she began to laugh and to say they mustn&rsquo;t
      lose that 7.30 to London or the &ldquo;rag&rdquo; would be rolling up without her and
      the &ldquo;stage damager&rdquo; would be using &ldquo;cuss words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had to pass the old church of Stoke Pogis on the way back to the
      town, and after looking at its timber belfry and steeple John suggested
      that they should see the inside. The sexton was found working in the
      garden at the side of the house, and he went indoors for the keys. &ldquo;Here
      they be, sir, and you being a pa&rsquo;son I&rsquo;ll bide in the orchet. You and your
      young missus can look at the church without me. &lsquo;A b&rsquo;lieve &lsquo;a hev seed it
      afore,&rdquo; he said with a twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was dark and cool. There was a window representing an angel
      ascending to heaven against a deep blue sky, and a squire&rsquo;s pew furnished
      like a box at the theatre, with a carpet and even a stove. The chairs in
      the front bore family crests, and behind them were inferior chairs,
      without crests, for the servants. John had opened the little modern organ
      and begun to play. After a while he began to sing. He sang Nazareth, and
      his voice filled the empty church and went up into the gloom of the roof,
      and echoed and returned, and it was almost as if another voice were
      singing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory stood by his side and listened; a wonderful peace had come down on
      her. Then the emotion that vibrated in his deep voice made something surge
      up to her throat. &ldquo;Life for evermore! Life for evermore!&rdquo; All at once she
      began to weep, to sob, and to laugh in a breath, and he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ridiculous I am to-day! You&rsquo;ll think me a maniac,&rdquo; she said. But he
      only took her hand as if she had been a child and led her out of the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insensibly the day had passed into evening, and the horizontal rays of the
      sun were dazzling their eyes as they returned to the hotel for tea. In
      giving orders for this meal they had left the illustrated weekly behind,
      and it was now clear from the easy smiles that greeted them that the paper
      had been looked at and Glory identified. The room was ready, with the
      table laid, the window closed, and a fire of wood in the dog grate, for
      the chill of the evening was beginning to be felt. And to make him forget
      what had happened at the church she put on a look of forced gaiety and
      talked rapidly, frivolously, and at random. The fresh air had given her
      such a colour that they would &lsquo;fairly eat her to-night.&rsquo; How tired she
      was, though! But a cup of tea would exhilarate her &ldquo;like a Johnnie&rsquo;s first
      whisky and soda in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with his grave face; every word was cutting him like a
      knife. &ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t tell the old folks at Glenfaba about the hospital
      until later?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Have a cup of the &lsquo;girl&rsquo;? They call champagne &lsquo;the boy&rsquo; at &lsquo;the
      back,&rsquo; so I call tea &lsquo;the girl,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when did you tell them about the music hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday. &lsquo;Muffins?&rsquo;&rdquo; and as she held out the plate she waggled the
      wrist of her other hand, and mimicked the cry of the muffin man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to excuse herself. What was the use of taking people by
      surprise? And then good people were sometimes so easily shocked! Education
      and upbringing, and prejudices and even blood&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you are ashamed of this life, believe me it is not a
      right one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashamed? Why should I be ashamed? Everybody is saying how proud I should
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke feverishly, and by a sudden impulse she plucked up the paper,
      but as suddenly let it drop again, for, looking at his grave face, her
      little fame seemed to shrivel up. &ldquo;But give a dog a bad name you know&mdash;&mdash;You
      were there on Monday night. Did you see anything, now&mdash;anything in
      the performance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the audience, Glory; that was enough for me. It is impossible for a
      girl to live long in an atmosphere like that and be a good woman. Yes, my
      child, impossible&rsquo; God forbid that I should sit in judgment on any man,
      still less on any woman!&mdash;but the women of the music hall, do they
      remain good women? Poor souls, they are placed in a position so false that
      it would require extraordinary virtue not to become false along with it!
      And the whiter the soul that is dragged through that&mdash;that mire, the
      more the defilement. The audiences at such places don&rsquo;t want the white
      soul, they don&rsquo;t want the good woman, they want the woman who has tasted
      of the tree of good and evil. You can see it in their faces, and hear it
      in their laughter, and measure it in their applause. Oh, I&rsquo;m only a
      priest, but I&rsquo;ve seen these places all the world over, and I know what I&rsquo;m
      saying, and I know it&rsquo;s true and you know it&rsquo;s true, Glory&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory leaped up from the table and her eyes seemed to emit fire. &ldquo;I know
      it&rsquo;s hard and cruel and pitiless, and, since you were there on Monday and
      saw how kind the audience was to <i>me</i>, it&rsquo;s personal and untrue as
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her voice broke and she sat down again and said in another tone: &ldquo;But,
      John, it&rsquo;s nearly a year, you know, since we saw each other last, and
      isn&rsquo;t it a pity? Tell me, where are you living now? Have you made your
      plans for the future? Oh, who do you think was with me just before you
      called yesterday? Polly&mdash;Polly Love, you remember! She&rsquo;s grown stout
      and plainer, poor thing, and I was so sorry&mdash;&mdash;Her brother was
      in your Brotherhood, wasn&rsquo;t he? Is he as strangely fond of her as ever? Is
      he? Eh? Don&rsquo;t you understand? Polly&rsquo;s brother, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, Glory. Yes, dead. He died a month ago. Poor boy, he died
      broken-hearted! He had come to hear of his sister&rsquo;s trouble at the
      hospital. I was to blame for that. He never looked up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence; both were gazing into the fire, and Glory&rsquo;s mouth was
      quivering. All at once she said: &ldquo;John&mdash;John Storm, why can&rsquo;t you
      understand that it&rsquo;s not the same with me as with other women? There seem
      to be two women in me always. After I left the hospital I went through a
      good deal. Nobody will ever know how much I went through. But even at the
      worst, somehow I seemed to enjoy and rejoice in everything. Things
      happened that made me cry, but there was another me that was laughing. And
      that&rsquo;s how it is with the life I am living now. It is not I myself that go
      through this&mdash;this mire, as you call it, it&rsquo;s only my other self, my
      lower self, if you like, but I am not touched by it at all. Don&rsquo;t you see
      that? Don&rsquo;t you, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are professions which are a source of temptation, and talents that
      are a snare, Glory&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see what you mean. There are not many ways a woman can succeed
      in&mdash;that&rsquo;s the cruelty of things. But there are a few, and I&rsquo;ve
      chosen the one I&rsquo;m fit for. And now, now that I&rsquo;ve escaped from all that
      misery, that meanness, and have brought the eyes of London upon me, and
      the world is full of smiles for me, and sunshine, and I am happy, you come
      at last, you that I couldn&rsquo;t find when I wanted you so much&mdash;oh, so
      much!&mdash;because you had forgotten me; you come to me out of a darkness
      like the grave and tell me to give it all up. Yes, yes, yes, that&rsquo;s what
      you mean&mdash;give it all up! Oh, it&rsquo;s cruel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She covered her face with her hands and sobbed. He bent over her with a
      sorrowful face and said, &ldquo;My child, if I have come out of a darkness as of
      the grave it is because I had <i>not</i> forgotten you there, but was
      thinking of you every day and hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sobbing ceased, but the tears still flowed through her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before that poor lad abandoned hope he came out into the world too-stole
      out-thinking to find his lost one. I told him to look for you first, and
      he went to the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. He passed me in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;Well, he came back anyway, and said you were gone, and all
      trace of you was lost. Did I forget you after that, Glory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His husky voice broke off suddenly, and he rose with a look of
      wretchedness. &ldquo;You are right, there are two selves in you, and the higher
      self is so pure, so strong, so unselfish, so noble&mdash;Oh, I am sure of
      it, Glory! Only there&rsquo;s no one to speak to it, no one. I try, but I can
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still crying behind her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meanwhile the lower self&mdash;there are only too many to speak to <i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands came down from her disordered face and she said, &ldquo;I know whom
      you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, you mean Mr. Drake. But you are mistaken. Mr. Drake has been
      a good friend to me, but he isn&rsquo;t anything else, and doesn&rsquo;t want to be.
      Can&rsquo;t you see that when you think of me and talk of me as you would of
      some other women you hurt me and degrade me, and I can not bear it? You
      see I am crying again&mdash;goodness knows why. But I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t give up my
      profession. The idea of such a thing! It&rsquo;s ridiculous! Think of Glory in a
      convent! One of the poor Clares perhaps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or back in the island serving out sewing at a mothers&rsquo; meeting! Give it
      up! Indeed I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall and you must!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll make me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she laughed out wildly, but stopped on the instant and looked up at
      him with glistening eyes. An intense blush came over her face, and her
      looks grew bright as his grew fierce. A moment afterward the waiting maid,
      with an inquisitive expression, was clearing the table and keeping a smile
      in reserve for &ldquo;the lovers&rsquo; quarrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the Guardsmen were in the train going back, and at the next
      station they changed to the carriage in which Glory and John were sitting.
      Apparently they had dined before leaving their club at Maidenhead, and
      they talked at Glory with covert smiles. &ldquo;Going to the Colosseum tonight?&rdquo;
       said one. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Oh, time enough. The
      attraction doesn&rsquo;t begin till ten, don&rsquo;t you know, and nobody goes
      before.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me she&rsquo;s rippin&rsquo;.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good&mdash;deuced good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory was sitting with her back to the engine drumming lightly on the
      window and looking out at the setting sun. At first she felt a certain
      shame at the obvious references, but, piqued at John&rsquo;s silence, she began
      to take pride in them, and shot glances at him from under half-closed
      eyelids. John was sitting opposite with his arms folded. At the talk of
      the men he felt his hands contract and his lips grow cold with the feeling
      that Glory belonged to everybody now and was common property. Once or
      twice he looked at them and became conscious of an impression, which had
      floated about him since he left the Brotherhood, that nearly every face he
      saw bore the hideous stamp of self-indulgence and sensuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the noises of the train helped him not to hear, and he looked out for
      London. It lay before them under a canopy of smoke, and now and then a
      shaft from the setting sun lit up a glass roof and it glittered like a
      sinister eye. Then there came from afar, over the creaking and groaning of
      the wheels and the whistle of the engine, the deep, multitudinous murmur
      of that distant sea. The mighty tide was rising and coming up to meet
      them. Presently they were dashing into the midst of it, and everything was
      drowned in the splash and roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Guardsmen, being on the platform side, alighted first, and on going
      off they bowed to Glory with rather more than easy manners. A dash of the
      devil prompted her to respond demonstratively, but John had risen and was
      taking off his hat to the men, and they were going away discomfited. Glory
      was proud of him&mdash;he was a man and a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put her into a hansom under the lamps outside the station, and her face
      was lit up, but she patted the dog and said: &ldquo;You have vexed me and you
      needn&rsquo;t come to see me again. I shall not sing properly this evening or
      sleep tonight at all, if that is any satisfaction to you, so you needn&rsquo;t
      trouble to inquire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached home Mrs. Callender told him of a shocking occurrence at
      the fashionable wedding at All Saints&rsquo; that morning. A young woman had
      committed suicide during the ceremony, and it turned out to be the poor
      girl who had been dismissed from the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm remembered Brother Paul. &ldquo;I must bury her,&rdquo; he thought.

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Glory sang that night with extraordinary vivacity and charm and was called
      back again and again. Going home in the cab she tried to live through the
      day afresh&mdash;every step, every act, every word, down to that
      triumphant &ldquo;<i>I</i> will.&rdquo; Her thoughts swayed as with the swaying of the
      hansom, but sometimes the thunderous applause of the audience broke in,
      and then she had to remember where she had left off. She could feel that
      beating against her breast still, and even smell the violets that grew by
      the pool. He had told her to give up everything, and there was an
      exquisite thrill in the thought that perhaps some day she would annihilate
      herself and all her ambitions, and&mdash;who knows what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      This mood lasted until Monday morning, when she was sitting in her room,
      dressing very slowly and smiling at herself in the glass, when the Cockney
      maid came in with a newspaper which her master had sent up on account of
      its long report of the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Church of All Saints&rsquo; was crowded by a fashionable congregation,
      among whom were many notable persons in the world of politics and society,
      including the father of the bridegroom, the Duke of &mdash;&mdash; and his
      brother, the Marquis of &mdash;&mdash;. An arch of palms crossed the nave
      at the entrance to the chancel, and festoons of rare flowers were
      suspended from the rails of the handsome screen. The altar and the table
      of the commandments were almost obscured by the wreaths of exotics that
      hung over them, and the columns of the colonnade, the font and offertory
      boxes were similarly buried in rich and lovely blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to an informal rehearsal some days before, the ceremony went off
      without a hitch. The officiating clergy were the Venerable Archdeacon
      Wealthy, D. D., assisted by the Rev. Josiah Golightly and other members of
      the numerous staff of All Saints&rsquo;. The service, which was fully choral,
      was under the able direction of the well-known organist and choirmaster,
      Mr. Carl Koenig, F. R. C. O., and the choir consisted of twenty adult and
      forty boy voices. On the arrival of the bride a procession was formed at
      the west entrance and proceeded up to the chancel, singing &lsquo;The voice that
      breathed o&rsquo;er Eden&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Polly!&rdquo; thought Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bride wore a duchess satin gown trimmed with chiffon and Brussels
      lace, and having a long train hung from the shoulders. Her tulle veil was
      fastened with a ruby brooch and with sprays of orange blossom sent
      specially from the Riviera, and her necklace consisted of a rope of
      graduated pearls fully a yard long, and understood to have belonged to the
      jewel case of Catharine of Russia. She carried a bouquet of flowers (the
      gift of the bridegroom) brought from Florida, the American home of her
      family. The bride&rsquo;s mother wore&mdash;&mdash; The bridesmaids were dressed&mdash;&mdash;Mr.
      Horatio Drake acted as best man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory drew her breath as with a spasm and threw down the newspaper. How
      blind she had been, how vain, how foolish! She had told John Storm that
      Drake was only a good friend to her, meaning him to understand that thus
      far she allowed him to go and no farther. But there was a whole realm of
      his life into which he did not ask her to enter. The &ldquo;notable persons in
      politics and society,&rdquo; &ldquo;the bridesmaids,&rdquo; these made up his real sphere,
      his serious scene. Other women were his friends, companions, equals,
      intimates, and when he stood in the eye of the world it was they who stood
      beside him. And she? She was his hobby. He came to her in his off hours.
      She filled up the under side of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a crushing sense of humiliation she was folding up the newspaper to
      send it downstairs when her eye was arrested by a paragraph in small type
      in the corner. It was headed &ldquo;Shocking occurrence at a fashionable
      wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good gracious!&rdquo; she cried. A glance had shown her what it was. It was
      a report of Polly&rsquo;s suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a fashionable wedding at a West-End church on Saturday&rdquo; (no names) &ldquo;a
      young woman who had been sitting in the nave was seen to rise and attempt
      to step into the aisle, as if with the intention of crushing her way out,
      when she fell back in convulsions, and on being removed was found to be
      dead. Happily, the attention of the congregation was at the moment
      directed to the bride and bridegroom, who were returning from the vestry
      with the bridal party behind them, and thus the painful incident made no
      sensation among the crowded congregation. The body was removed to the
      parish mortuary, and from subsequent inquiries it transpired that death
      had been due to poison self-administered, and that the deceased was
      Elizabeth Anne Love (twenty-four), of no occupation, but formerly a nurse&mdash;a
      circumstance which had enabled her to procure half a grain of liquor
      strychninae on her own signature at a chemist&rsquo;s where she had been known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! O God!&rdquo; Glory understood everything now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind to go
      to All Saints&rsquo; and shame them&mdash;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t the police I&rsquo;m afraid
      of.&rdquo; Polly&rsquo;s purpose was clear. She had intended to fall dead at the feet
      of the bride and bridegroom and make them walk over her body. Poor,
      foolish, ineffectual Polly! Her very ghost must be ashamed of the failure
      of her revenge. Not a ripple of sensation on Saturday, and this morning
      only a few obscure lines in little letters!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it was hideous! The poor thing&rsquo;s vengeance was theatrical and paltry,
      but what of the man, wherever he was? What did he think of himself now,
      with his millions and his murder? Yes, his murder, for what else was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Glory was ringing the bell of a little house in St. John&rsquo;s
      Wood whereof the upper blinds were drawn. The grating of the garden door
      slid back and an untidy head looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me, Liza?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd, yus, miss!&rdquo; and the door was opened immediately; &ldquo;but I was afeard
      you was one o&rsquo; them reportin&rsquo; people, and my orders is not to answer no
      questions.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has <i>he</i> been here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blesh ye, no, miss! He&rsquo;s on &lsquo;is way to the Continents. But &lsquo;is friend
      &lsquo;as, and he&rsquo;s settled everything &lsquo;andsome&mdash;I will say that for the
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory felt her gall rising; there was something degrading, almost
      disreputable, even in the loyalty of Drake&rsquo;s friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy Liza not knowing you, miss, and me at the moosic &lsquo;all a Tuesday
      night! I &lsquo;ope you&rsquo;ll excuse the liberty, but I <i>did</i> laugh, and I
      won&rsquo;t say but I shed a few tears too. Arranged? Yes, the jury and the
      coroner and every-think. It&rsquo;s to be at twelve o&rsquo;clock, so you may think
      I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad my &lsquo;ands full. But you&rsquo;ll want to look at &lsquo;er, pore thing! Go up,
      miss, and mind yer &lsquo;ead; there&rsquo;s nobody but &lsquo;er friends with &lsquo;er now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friends proved to be Betty Belmont and her dressing-room companions.
      When Glory entered they showed no surprise. &ldquo;The pore child told us all
      about you,&rdquo; said Betty; and the little one said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your nyme that
      caught on, dear. The minute I heard it I said what a top-line for a,
      bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the same little bandbox of a bedroom, only now it was darkened and
      Polly&rsquo;s troubles were over. There was a slightly convulsed look about the
      mouth, but the features were otherwise calm and childlike, for all the
      dead are innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three women with demure faces were sipping Benedictine and talking
      among themselves, and Polly&rsquo;s pug dog was coiled up on the bare bolster
      and snoring audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pore thing! I don&rsquo;t know how she could &lsquo;a done it. But there, that&rsquo;s the
      worst of this life! It&rsquo;s all in the present and leads to nothing and ain&rsquo;t
      got no future.&rdquo; &ldquo;What could the pore thing do? She wasn&rsquo;t so wonderful
      pretty; and then men like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;She was str&rsquo;ight with him, say
      what yer like. Only she ought to been more patienter, and she needn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a
      been so hard on the lady, neither.&rdquo; &ldquo;She had everything the heart could
      wish. Look at her rooms! I wonder who&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carriages were heard outside, and two or three men came in to do the last
      offices. Glory had turned her face away, but behind her the women were
      still talking. &ldquo;Wait a minute, mister! ... What a lovely ring! ... I wish
      I had a keepsake to remember her by.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, and why not? She won&rsquo;t want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory felt as if she was choking, but Polly&rsquo;s pug dog had been awakened by
      the commotion and was beginning to howl, so she took up the little mourner
      and carried it out. An organ-man somewhere near was playing Sweet Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral was at Kensal Green, and the four girls were the only
      followers. The coroner&rsquo;s verdict being <i>felo-de-se</i>, the body was not
      taken into the chapel, but a clergyman met it at the gate and led the way
      to the grave. Walking with her head down and the dog under her arm, Glory
      had not seen him at first, but when he began with the tremendous words, &ldquo;I
      am the resurrection and the life,&rdquo; she caught her breath and looked up. It
      was John Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were in the carriage the clouds had been gathering, and now
      some spots of rain were falling. When the bearers had laid down their
      burden the spots were large and frequent, and all save one of the men
      turned and went back to the shelter of the porch. The three women looked
      at each other, and one of them muttered something about &ldquo;the dead and the
      living,&rdquo; and then the little lady stole away. After a moment the tall one
      followed her, and from shame of being ashamed the third one went off also.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the rain was falling in a sharp shower, and John Storm, who
      was bareheaded, had opened his book and begun to read: &ldquo;Forasmuch as it
      hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul
      of our dear sister here departed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw that Glory was alone by the graveside, and his voice faltered
      and almost failed him. It faltered again, and he halted when he came to
      the &ldquo;sure and certain hope,&rdquo; but after a moment it quivered and filled out
      and seemed to say, &ldquo;Which of us can sound the depths of God&rsquo;s design?&rdquo;
       After the &ldquo;maimed rites&rdquo; were over, John Storm went back to the chapel to
      remove his surplice, and when he returned to the grave Glory was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang as usual at the music hall that night, but with a heavy heart.
      The difference communicated itself to the audience, and the unanimous
      applause which had greeted her before frayed off at length into separate
      hand-claps. Crossing the stage to her dressing-room she met Koenig, who
      came to conduct for her, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite yourself to-night, my dear, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going home in the hansom, Polly&rsquo;s dog coddled up with the old sympathy to
      the new mistress, and seemed to be making the best of things. The
      household was asleep, and Glory let herself in with a latch-key. Her cold
      supper was laid ready, and a letter was lying under the turned-down lamp.
      It was from her grandfather, and had been written after church on Sunday
      night:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is now so long&mdash;more than a year&mdash;since I saw my runaway and
      truant that, notwithstanding the protests of Aunt Anna and the forebodings
      of Aunt Rachel, I have determined to give my old legs a journey and my old
      eyes a treat. Therefore take warning that I intend to come up to London
      forthwith, that I may see the great city for the first time in my life,
      and&mdash;which is better&mdash;my little granddaughter among all her new
      friends and in the midst of her great prosperity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of this there was a postscript from Aunt Rachel, hastily
      scrawled in pencil:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take no notice of this. He is far too weak to travel, and indeed he is
      really failing; but your letter, which reached us last night, has so
      troubled him ever since that he can&rsquo;t take rest for thinking of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the last straw. Before finishing the letter or taking off her hat,
      Glory took up a telegraph form and wrote, &ldquo;Postpone journey&mdash;am
      returning home to-morrow.&rdquo; Then she heard Koenig letting himself into the
      house, and going downstairs she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take this message to the telegraph office for me, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vhy, of course I vill, and den ve&rsquo;ll have supper togeder&mdash;look!&rdquo; and
      he laughed and opened a paper and drew out a string of sausages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Koenig,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you were right. I was not myself to-night. I want
      a rest, and I propose to take one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Glory returned upstairs she heard stammerings, sputterings, and
      swearings behind her about managers, engagements, announcements, geniuses,
      children, and other matters. Back in her room she lay down on the floor,
      with her face in her hands, and sobbed. Then Koenig appeared, panting and
      saying: &ldquo;Dere! I knew vhat vould happen! Here&rsquo;s a pretty ting! And dat&rsquo;s
      vhy Mr. Drake told me to deny you to de man. De brute, de beast, de dirty
      son of a monk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Glory had leaped up with eyes of fire, and was crying: &ldquo;How dare you,
      sir? Out of my room this instant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mein Gott! It&rsquo;s a divil!&rdquo; Koenig was muttering like a servant as he went
      downstairs. He went out to the telegraph office and came back, and then
      Glory heard him frying his sausages on the dining-room fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was far gone when she pushed aside her untouched supper, and,
      wiping her eyes, that she might see properly, sat down to write a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear John Storm (monk, monster, or whatever it is!): I trust it will be
      counted to me for righteousness that I am doing your bidding and giving up
      my profession&mdash;for the present.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Between a woman&rsquo;s &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;no&rsquo; 
  There isn&rsquo;t room for a pin to go,
</pre>
    <p>
      which is very foolish of her in this instance, considering that she is
      earning various pounds a night and has nothing but Providence to fall back
      upon. I have told my jailer I must have my liberty, and, being a man of
      like passions with yourself, he has been busy blaspheming in the parlour
      downstairs. I trust virtue will be its own reward, for I dare say it is
      all I shall ever get. If I were Narcissus I should fall in love with
      myself to-day, having shown an obedience to tyranny which is beautiful and
      worthy of the heroic age. But to-morrow morning I go back to the &lsquo;oilan,&rsquo; 
      and it will be so nice up there without anybody and all alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was laughing softly to herself as she wrote, and catching her breath
      with a little sob at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter now and then is profitable to the soul of man&mdash;and&mdash;woman;
      but you must not expect to hear from <i>me</i>, and as for you, though you
      <i>have</i> resurrected yourself, I suppose a tyrant of your opinions will
      continue the Benedictine rule which compels you to hold your peace&mdash;and
      other things. I am engaged to breakfast with a nice girl named Glory
      Quayle to-morrow morning&mdash;that is to say, <i>this</i> morning&mdash;at
      Euston Station at a quarter to seven, but happily this letter won&rsquo;t reach
      you until 7.30, so I&rsquo;ll just escape interruption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house was still and the streets were quiet, not even a cab going
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye! I&rsquo;ve realized&mdash;a dog! It&rsquo;s a pug, and therefore, like
      somebody else, it always looks black at me, though I suspect its father
      married beneath him, for it talks a good deal, and evidently hasn&rsquo;t been
      brought up in a Brotherhood. Therefore, being a &lsquo;female,&rsquo; I intend to call
      it Aunt Anna&mdash;except when the original is about. Aunt Anna has been
      hopping up and down the room at my heels for the last hour, evidently
      thinking that a rational woman would behave better if she went to bed.
      Perhaps I shall take a leaf out of your book and &lsquo;comb her hair,&rsquo; when I
      get her all alone in the train to-morrow, that she may be prepared for the
      new sphere to which it has pleased Providence to call her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye again! I see the lamps of Euston running after each other, only
      it&rsquo;s the <i>other</i> way this time. I find there is something that seizes
      you with a fiercer palpitation than coming <i>into</i> a great and
      wonderful city, and that is going out of one. Dear old London! After all,
      it has been very good to me. No one, it seems to me, loves it as much as I
      do. Only somebody thinks&mdash;well, never mind! Goodbye &lsquo;for all!&rsquo; 
      Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At seven next morning, on the platform at Euston, Glory was standing with
      melancholy eyes at the door of a first-class compartment watching the
      people sauntering up and down, talking in groups and hurrying to and fro,
      when Drake stepped up to her. She did not ask what had brought him&mdash;she
      knew. He looked fresh and handsome, and was faultlessly dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are doing quite right, my dear,&rdquo; he said in a cheerful voice. &ldquo;Koenig
      telegraphed, and I came to see you off. Don&rsquo;t bother about the theatre;
      leave everything to me. Take a rest after your great excitement, and come
      back bright and well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The locomotive whistled and began to pant, the smoke rose to the roof, the
      train started, and before Glory knew she was going she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Drake walked to his club and wrote this postscript to a letter to
      Lord Robert Ure, at the Grand Hotel, Paris: &ldquo;The Parson has drawn first
      blood, and Gloria has gone home!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the Sunday evening after Glory&rsquo;s departure John Storm, with the
      bloodhound running by his side, made his way to Soho in search of the
      mother of Brother Andrew. He had come to a corner of a street where the
      walls of an ugly brick church ran up a narrow court and turned into a
      still narrower lane at the back. The church had been for some time
      disused, and its facade was half covered with boardings and plastered with
      placards: &ldquo;Brighton and Back, 3<i>s</i>.&rdquo;; &ldquo;<i>Lloyd&rsquo;s News</i>&rdquo;; &ldquo;Coals,
      1<i>s</i>. a cwt.&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Barclay&rsquo;s Sparkling Ales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a tumult in the court and lane. In the midst of a close-packed
      ring of excited people, chiefly foreigners, shouting in half the languages
      of Europe, a tall young Cockney, with bloated face and eyes aflame with
      drink, was writhing and wrestling and cursing. Sometimes he escaped from
      the grasp of the man who held him, and then he flung himself against the
      closed door of a shop which stood opposite, with the three balls of the
      pawnbroker suspended above it. Somebody within the shop was howling for
      help. It was a woman&rsquo;s voice, and the louder she screamed the more violent
      were the man&rsquo;s efforts to beat down the door between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As John Storm stood a moment looking on, some one on the street beside him
      said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a d&mdash;&mdash; shyme.&rdquo; It was a man with a feeble,
      ineffectual face and the appearance of a waiter. Seeing he had been
      overheard, the man stammered: &ldquo;Beg parding, sir; but they may well say
      &lsquo;when the Devil can&rsquo;t come hisself &lsquo;e sends &lsquo;is brother Drink.&rsquo;&rdquo; Having
      said this he began to move along, but stopped suddenly on seeing what the
      clergyman with the dog was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was pushing his way through the crowd, and his black figure in
      that writhing ring of undersized foreigners looked big and commanding.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he was saying in a husky voice that rose clear above the
      clamour. The shouting and swearing subsided, all save the howling from the
      inside of the shop, and the tumult settled down in a moment to mutterings
      and gnashings and a broken and irregular silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then somebody said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothink, sir.&rdquo; And somebody else said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Es on&rsquo;y
      drunk, and wantin&rsquo; to pench &lsquo;is mother.&rdquo; Without listening to this
      explanation John Storm had laid hold of the young man by the collar and
      was dragging him, struggling and fuming, from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Will nobody speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a poor swaggering imitation of a man came up out of the cellar of a
      house that stood next to the disused church, and a comely young woman
      carrying a baby followed close behind him. He had a gin bottle in his
      hands, and with a wink he said: &ldquo;A christenin&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going
      on. &lsquo;Ave a kepple o&rsquo; pen&rsquo;orth of &lsquo;ollands, old gel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this sally the crowd recovered its audacity and laughed, and the
      drunken man began to say that he could &ldquo;knock spots out of any bloomin&rsquo; 
      parson, en&rsquo; now bloomin&rsquo; errer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the young fellow with the gin bottle broke in again. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer gime,
      mister? Preach the gawspel? Give us trecks? This is my funeral, down&rsquo;t ye
      know, and I&rsquo;d jest like to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little foreigners were enjoying the parson-baiting, and the drunken
      man&rsquo;s courage was rising to fever heat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give &lsquo;im one-two between the
      eyes if &lsquo;e touches me again.&rdquo; Then he flung himself on the pawnshop like a
      battering ram, the howling inside, which had subsided, burst out afresh,
      and finally the door was broken down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a minute afterward the crowd was making a wavering dance about the
      two men. &ldquo;Look out, ducky!&rdquo; the young fellow shouted to John. The warning
      came too late&mdash;John went reeling backward from a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my lads, who says next?&rdquo; cried the drunken ruffian. But before the
      words were out of his mouth there was a growl, a plunge, a snarl, and he
      was full length on the street with the bloodhound&rsquo;s muzzle at his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd shrieked and began to fly. Only one person seemed to remain. It
      was an elderly woman, with dry and straggling gray hair. She had come out
      of the pawnshop and thrown herself on the dog in an effort to rescue the
      man underneath, crying: &ldquo;My son&mdash;oh, my son! It&rsquo;ll kill him! Tyke the
      beast away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm called the dog off, and the man got up unhurt, and nearly
      sober. But the woman continued to moan over the ruffian and to assail John
      and his dog with bitter insults. &ldquo;We want no truck with parsons &lsquo;ere,&rdquo; she
      shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stou thet, mother. It was my fault,&rdquo; said the sobered man, and then the
      woman began to cry. At the next minute John Storm was going with mother
      and son into the shut-up pawnshop, and the unhinged door was being propped
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd was trailing off when he came out again half an hour afterward,
      and the only commotion remaining was caused by a belated policeman asking,
      &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s bin the matter &lsquo;ere?&rdquo; and by the young fellow with the gin bottle
      performing a step-dance on the pavement before the entrance to the cellar.
      The old woman stood at her door wiping her eyes on her apron, and her son
      was behind with a face that was now red from other causes than drink and
      rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mrs. Pincher; I may see you again soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing this, the young swaggerer stopped his step-dancing and cried:
      &ldquo;What cheer, myte? Was it a blowter and a cup of cawfy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shynie, Charlie!&rdquo; cried the girl with a baby, and the young fellow
      answered, &ldquo;Shut yer &lsquo;ead, Aggie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter was still at the corner of the court, and when John came up he
      spoke again. &ldquo;There must be sem amoosement knockin&rsquo; women abart, but I
      can&rsquo;t see it myself.&rdquo; Then in a simple way he began to talk about his
      &ldquo;missis,&rdquo; and what a good creature she was, and finally announced himself
      &ldquo;gyme&rdquo; to help a parson &ldquo;as stood up to that there drunken blowke for sake
      of a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jupe,&rdquo; said the man, and then something stirred in John&rsquo;s memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day John Storm dined with his uncle at Downing Street.
      The Prime Minister was waiting in the library. In evening dress, with his
      back to the fireplace and his hands enlaced behind him, he looked even
      more thin and gaunt than before. He welcomed John with a few familiar
      words and a smile. His smile was brief and difficult, like that which
      drags across the face of an invalid. Dinner was announced immediately, and
      the old man took the young one&rsquo;s arm and they passed into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panelled chamber looked cold and cheerless. It was lighted by a single
      lamp in the middle of the table. They took their seats at opposite sides.
      The statesman&rsquo;s thin hair shone on his head like streaks of silver. John
      exercised a strong physical influence upon him, and all through the dinner
      his bleak face kept smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to apologize for having nobody to meet you, but I had something
      to say&mdash;something to suggest&mdash;and I thought perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John interrupted with affectionate protestations, and a tremor passed over
      the wrinkles about the old man&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great happiness to me, my dear boy, that you have turned your
      back on that Brotherhood, but I presume you intend to adhere to the
      Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John intended to take priest&rsquo;s orders without delay, and then go on with
      his work as a clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, just so&rdquo;&mdash;the long, tapering fingers drummed on the table&mdash;&ldquo;and
      I should like to do something to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then sipping at his wine-glass of water, the Prime Minister, in his slow,
      deep voice and official tone, began to detail his scheme. There was a
      bishopric vacant. It was only a colonial one&mdash;the Bishopric of
      Colombo. The income was small, no more than seventeen hundred pounds, the
      work was not light, and there were fifty clergy. Then a colonial bishopric
      was not usually a stepping-stone to preferment at home, yet still&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      John interrupted again. &ldquo;You are most kind, uncle, but I am only looking
      forward to living the life of a poor priest, out of sight of the world and
      the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely Colombo is sufficiently out of sight, my boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I see no necessity to leave London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister glanced at him steadily, with the concentrated
      expression of a man who is accustomed to penetrate the thoughts and
      feelings of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then&mdash;why did you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I leave the monastery, uncle? Because I had come to see that the
      monastic system was based on a faulty ideal of Christianity, which had
      been tried for the greater part of nineteen hundred years and failed. The
      theory of monasticism is that Christ died to redeem our carnal nature, and
      all we have to do is to believe and pray. But it is not enough that Christ
      died once. He must be dying always&mdash;every day&mdash;and in every one
      of us. God is calling on us in this age to seek a new social application
      of the Gospel, or, shall I say, to go back to the old one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To present Christ in practical life as the living Master and King and
      example, and to apply Christianity to the life of our own time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister had not taken his eyes off him. &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;
       he had asked himself, but he only smiled his difficult smile and began to
      talk lightly. If this creed applied to the individual it applied also to
      the State; but think of a cabinet conducting the affairs of a nation on
      the charming principle of &ldquo;taking no thought for the morrow,&rdquo; and &ldquo;loving
      your enemies,&rdquo; and &ldquo;turning the other cheek,&rdquo; and &ldquo;selling all and giving
      to the poor&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      John stuck to his guns. If the Christian religion could not be the
      ultimate authority to rule a Christian nation, it was only because we
      lacked faith and trusted too much to mechanical laws made by statesmen
      rather than to moral laws made by Christ. &ldquo;Either the life of Christ, as
      the highest standard and example, means something or it means nothing. If
      something, let us try to follow it; but if nothing, then for God&rsquo;s sake
      let us put it away as a cruel, delusive, and damnable mummery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister continued to ask himself, &ldquo;What is the key to this?&rdquo;
       and to look at John as he would have looked at a problem that had to be
      solved, but he only went on smiling and talking lightly. It was true we
      said a prayer and took an oath on the Bible in the Houses of Parliament,
      but did anybody think for a moment that we intended to trust the nation to
      the charming romanticism of the politics of Jesus? As for the Church, it
      was founded on acts of Parliament, it was endowed and established by the
      State, its head was the sovereign, its clergy were civil servants who went
      to levées and hung on the edge of drawing-rooms and troubled the knocker
      of No. 10 Downing-Street. And as for Christ&rsquo;s laws&mdash;in this country
      they were interpreted by the Privy Council and were under the direct
      control of a State department. Still, it was a harmless superstition that
      we were a Christian nation. It helped to curb the masses of the people,
      and if that was what John was thinking of&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister paused and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, my boy,&rdquo; touching John&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;do you intend yourself to live&mdash;in
      short, the&mdash;well, after the example of the life of Christ?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as my weak and vain and sinful nature will permit, uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in what way would you propose to apply your new idea of
      Christianity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My experiment would be made on a social basis, sir, and first of all in
      relation to women.&rdquo; John was hot all over, and his face had flushed up to
      the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister glanced stealthily across the table, passed his thin
      hand across his forehead, and thought, &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is!&rdquo; But John was
      deep in his theme and saw nothing. The present position of women was
      intolerable. Upon the well-being of women, especially of working women,
      the whole welfare of society rested. Yet what was their condition? Think
      of it&mdash;their dependence on man, their temptations, their rewards,
      their punishments! Three halfpence an hour was the average wage of a
      working woman in England!&mdash;and that in the midst of riches, in the
      heart of luxury, and with one easy and seductive means of escape from
      poverty always open. Ruin lay in wait for them, and was beckoning them and
      enticing them in the shape of dancing houses and music halls and rich and
      selfish men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one man in a million, sir, would come through such an ordeal
      unharmed. And yet what do we do?&mdash;what does the Church do for these
      brave creatures on whose virtue and heroism the welfare of the nation
      depends? If they fall it cuts them off, and there is nothing before them
      but the streets or crime or the Union or suicide. And meanwhile it marries
      the men who have tempted them to the snug and sheltered darlings for whose
      wealth or rank or beauty they have been pushed aside. Oh, uncle, when I
      walk down Regent Street in the daytime I am angry, but when I walk down
      Regent Street at night I am ashamed. And then to think of the terrible
      solitude of London to working girls who want to live pure lives&mdash;the
      terrible spiritual loneliness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s voice was breaking, but the Prime Minister had almost ceased to
      hear. Thinking he had realized the truth at last, his own youth seemed to
      be sitting before him and he felt a deep pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee here or in the library, your lordship?&rdquo; said the man at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The library,&rdquo; he answered, and taking John&rsquo;s arm again he returned to the
      other room. There was a fire burning now, and a book lay under the lamp on
      a little table, with a silver paper-cutter through the middle to mark the
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you remind me of your mother sometimes, John! That was just like her
      voice, do you know&mdash;just!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours afterward he led John Storm down the long corridor to the hall.
      His bleak face looked soft and his deep voice had a slight tremor.
      &ldquo;Good-night, my dear boy, and remember your money is always waiting for
      you. Until your Christian social state is established you are only an
      advocate of socialism, and may fairly use your own. If yours is the
      Christianity of the first century it has to exist in the nineteenth, you
      know. You can&rsquo;t live on air or fly without wings. I shall be curious to
      see what approach, to the Christian ideal the condition of civilization
      admits of. Yet I don&rsquo;t know what your religious friends and the humdrum
      herd will think of you&mdash;mad probably, or at least weak and childish
      and perhaps even a hunter after easy popularity. But good-night, and God
      bless you in, your people&rsquo;s church and Devil&rsquo;s Acre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was flushed and excited. He had been talking of his plans, his hopes,
      his expectations. God would provide for him in this as in everything, and
      then God&rsquo;s priest ought to be God&rsquo;s poor. Meantime two gentlemen in plush
      waited for him at the door. One handed him his hat, the other his stick
      and gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with regular steps, and his hands behind him, the Prime Minister
      paced back through the quiet corridors. Returning to the library, he took
      up his book and tried to read. It was a novel, but he could not attend to
      the incidents in other people&rsquo;s lives. From time to time he said to
      himself: &ldquo;Poor boy! Will he find her? Will he save her?&rdquo; One pathetic idea
      had fixed itself on his mind&mdash;John Storm&rsquo;s love of God was love of a
      woman, and she was fallen and wrecked and lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight later John wrote to Glory:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly under weigh at last, dear Glory! Taken priest&rsquo;s orders, got the
      Bishop&rsquo;s &lsquo;license to officiate,&rsquo; and found myself a church. It is St. Mary
      Magdalene&rsquo;s, Crown Street, Soho, a district that has borne for three
      hundred years the name of the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Acre,&rsquo; bears it still, and deserves
      it. The church is an old proprietary place, licensed, not consecrated,
      formerly belonging to Greek, or Italian, or French, or some other
      refugees, but long shut up and now much out of repair. Present owners, a
      company of Greek merchants, removed from Soho to the City, and being too
      poor (as trustees) to renovate the structure, they have forced me to get
      money for that purpose from my uncle, the Prime Minister. But the money is
      my own, apparently, my uncle having in my interest demanded from my father
      ten thousand pounds out of my mother&rsquo;s dowry, and got it. And now I am
      spending two thousand on the repair of my church buildings,
      notwithstanding the protests of the Prime Minister, who calls me &lsquo;chaplain
      to the Greek-Turks,&rsquo; and of Mrs. Callender, who has discovered that I am a
      &lsquo;maudlin, sentimental, daft young spendthrift.&rsquo; Dare say I am all that and
      a good deal more, as the wise world counts wisdom&mdash;but it matters
      little!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have not waited for the workmen, though, to begin operations. Took first
      services last Sunday. No organist, no choir, no clerk, and next to no
      congregation. Just the church cleaner, a good, simple old soul named
      Pincher, her son, a reformed drunkard and pawnbroker, and another convert
      who is a club waiter. Nevertheless, I went through the whole service,
      morning and evening, prayers, psalms, and sermon. God will be the more
      glorified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have started my new crusade on behalf of women, too, and made various
      processions of three persons through the streets of Soho. First, my
      pawnbroker bearing the banner (a white cross, the object of various
      missiles), next my waiter carrying a little harmonium, and familiarly
      known as the &lsquo;organ man,&rsquo; and finally myself in my cassock. Last mentioned
      proves to be a highly popular performance, being generally understood to
      be a man in a black petticoat. We have had a nightly accompaniment of a
      much larger procession, though, calling themselves &lsquo;Skellingtons,&rsquo; 
      otherwise the &lsquo;Skeletons,&rsquo; an army of low women and roughs; who live
      vulture lives on this poor, soiled, grimy, forgotten world. Thank God, the
      ground of evil-doers is in danger, and they know it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behind my church, in a dark, unwholesome alley called. Crook Lane, we
      have a clergy house, at present let out in tenements, the cellar being
      occupied as a gin shop. As soon as these premises can be cleared of their
      encumbrances I shall turn them into a club for working girls. Why not? In
      the old days the Church came to the people: let it come to the people now.
      Here we are in the midst of this mighty stronghold of the devil&rsquo;s kingdom
      of sin and crime. Foreign clubs, casinos, dancing academies, and gambling
      houses are round about us. What are we to do? Put up a forest of props (as
      at the Abbey) and keep off touch and contamination? God forbid! Let us go
      down into these dens of moral disease and disinfect them. The poor working
      girls, of Soho want their Sunday: give it them. They want music and
      singing: give it them. They want dancing: give them that also, for God&rsquo;s
      sake, give it them in your churches, or the devil will give it them in his
      hells!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expect to be howled at of course. Some good people will think I am either
      a fanatic or an artful schemer, while the clerical place-seekers, who love
      the flesh-pots of Egypt and have their eyes on the thrones of the Church
      and the world, will denounce my &lsquo;secularity&rsquo; and tell me I am feeding the
      &lsquo;miry troughs&rsquo; of the publican and sinner. No matter, if only God is
      pleased to vouchsafe &lsquo;signs following.&rsquo; And one weary-faced lonely girl,
      grown fresh of countenance and happy of mien, or one bright little woman,
      snatched from the brink of perdition, will be a better fruit, of religion
      than some of them have seen for many a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as the workmen have cleared out I am going to establish a daily
      service and keep the church open always. Still at Mrs. Callender&rsquo;s, you
      see; but I am refusing all invitations, except as a priest, and already I
      don&rsquo;t seem to, have time to draw my breath. No income connected with St.
      Mary Magdalene&rsquo;s, or next to none, just enough to pay the caretaker; but I
      must not complain of that, for it is the accident to which I owe my
      church, nobody else wanting it under the circumstances. I had begun to
      think my time in the monastery wasted, but God knew better. It will help
      me to live the life of poverty, of purity, of freedom from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love to the grandfather and the ladies. How I wish you were with me in
      the thick of the fight! Sometimes I dream you are, too, and I fancy I see
      you in the midst of these bright young things with their flowers and
      feathers&mdash;they will make beautiful Christians yet! Oddly enough, on
      the day you travelled to the island, every hour that took you farther away
      seemed to bring you nearer. Greetings!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glenfaba, &rsquo;the Oilan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, gracious and grateful friend, at length you have remembered the
      existence of the &lsquo;poor lone crittur&rsquo; living in dead-alive land! Only that
      I lack gall to make oppression bitter, I should of course return your
      belated epistle by the Dead Letter Office, marked &lsquo;Unknown&rsquo; across your
      &lsquo;Dear Glory,&rsquo; there being no longer anybody in these regions who has a
      plausible claim to that dubious title. But, alas! I am not my own woman
      now, and with tears of shame I acknowledge that <i>any</i> letter from
      London comes like an angel&rsquo;s whisper breathed to me through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you have been unreasonable enough to think that I ought to
      have written to tell you of my arrival; and knowing that man is born to
      vanity as the sparks fly upward, I have more than once intended to take
      pen in hand and write; but there is something so sleepy in this island
      atmosphere that my good resolution has hitherto been a stillborn babe that
      has breathed but never cried!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know then that my journey hither was performed with due celerity and no
      further disaster than befalls me when, as usual, I have <i>done</i> those
      things which I ought not to have done, and left <i>undone</i> those things
      which I ought to have done&mdash;the former in this instance having
      reference to various bouts of crying&mdash;which drew forth the sympathy
      of a compassionate female sharper in the train&mdash;and the latter to the
      catch of my sachel, which enabled that obliging person to draw forth my
      embroidered pocket-handkerchief in exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in good time for the steamboat at Liverpool, and it was crowded,
      according to its wont, with the Lancashire lads and lasses, in whom
      affection is as contagious as the mumps. Being in the dumps myself on
      sailing out of the river, and thinking of the wild excitement with which I
      had sailed into it, I think I should have found that I had not <i>done</i>
      crying in both senses but for the interest of watching an amiable Bob
      Brierley who, with his arm about the waist of the person sitting next to
      him, kept looking round at the rest of the world from time to time with
      the innocence of one whose left hand didn&rsquo;t know what his right hand was
      doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we had hardly crossed the bar when the prince of the powers of the
      air began to envy the happiness of these dear young goodies, and if you
      had seen the weather for the next four hours you would have agreed that
      the devil must have had a hand in it! Up came a wave over the after
      quarter and down went the passengers below decks, staggering and screaming
      like brewery rats, and then on we came like the Israelites out of Egypt on
      eagles&rsquo; wings! Having lost my own sea legs a little I thought it prudent
      to go down too, with my doggie tucked under my arm, and finding a berth in
      the ladies&rsquo; cabin, I fell asleep and didn&rsquo;t awake until we were in the
      cross-current just off the island, when, amid moans and groans and other
      noises, I heard the tearful voice of a sick passenger asking, &lsquo;Is there
      any hope, stewardess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The train got to Peel as the sun was setting behind the grim old castle
      walls, and when I saw the dear little town again I dropped half a tear,
      and even felt an insane desire to run out to meet it. Grandfather was at
      the station with old &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; and the pony carriage, and when I had done
      kissing him and he had done panting and puffing and talking nonsense, as
      if I had been Queen Victoria and the Empress of the French rolled into
      one, I could have cried to see how small and feeble he had become since I
      went away. We could not get off immediately, for in his simple joy at my
      return he was hailing everybody and everybody was hailing him, and the
      dear old Pharisee was sounding his trumpet so often in the market-place,
      that he might have glory of men, that I thought we should never get up to
      Glenfaba that night. When we did so at length the old aunties were waiting
      at the gate, and then he broke into exclamations again. &lsquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she grown
      tall? Look at her! Hasn&rsquo;t she, now?&rsquo; Whereupon the aunties took up their
      parable with, &lsquo;Well, well! Aw, well! Aw, well now! Well, ye navar!&rsquo; So
      that by the time I got through I had kissed everybody a dozen times, and
      was as red over the eyes as a grouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we went into the house, and for the first five minutes I couldn&rsquo;t
      tell what had come over the old place to make it look so small and mean.
      It was just as if the walls of the rooms had been the bellows of a
      concertina and somebody had suddenly shut them. But there was the long
      clock clucking away on the landing, and there was Sir Thomas Traddles
      purring on the hearth-rug, and there were the same plates on the dresser,
      and the same map of Africa over the fireplace, with a spot of red ink
      where my father died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moon was glistening on the sea when I went to bed that night, and
      when I got up in the morning the sun was shining on it, and a crow cut
      across my window cawing, and I heard grandfather humming to himself on the
      path below. And after my long spell in London, and my railway journey of
      the day before, it was the same as if I had fallen asleep in a gale on the
      high seas and awakened in a quiet harbour somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here I am, back at Glenfaba, in my old little room with my old little
      bed, and everything exactly as it used to be; and I begin to believe that
      when you went into that monastery you only just got the start of me in
      being dead. There used to be a few people in this place, but now there
      doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a dog left. All the youngsters have &lsquo;gone foreign,&rsquo; and
      all the oldsters have gone to&mdash;&lsquo;goodness knows which.&rsquo; Sometimes we
      hear the bleat of sheep on the mountains, and sometimes the scream of
      seagulls overhead, and sometimes we hold a convocation of all living rooks
      in the elms on the lawn. We take no thought for the morrow, what we shall
      eat or what we shall put on, and on Sundays when the church bell rings we
      go out, like the Israelites in the wilderness, in clothes which wax not
      old after forty years. During the rest of the week we watch the
      blue-bottles knocking their stupid heads against the ceiling, and listen
      to the grasshoppers whispering in the grass, and fall asleep to the hum of
      the bees, and awake to the <i>hee-haw</i> of old Neilus&rsquo;s &lsquo;canary.&rsquo; [*
      Donkey] Such is the dead-alive life we live at Glenfaba, and the days of
      our years are threescore years and ten, and if.... Ohoy! (A yawn.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is basely ungrateful of me to talk like this, for the dear
      place itself is lovely enough to disturb one&rsquo;s hope of paradise, and this
      very morning is as fresh as the dew on the grass, with the larks singing
      above, and the river singing below, and clouds like little curls of foam
      hovering over the sea. And as for my three dear old dunces, who love me so
      much more than I deserve, I am ashamed in my soul when I overhear them
      planning good things for me to eat, and wild excitements for me to revel
      in, that I may not be dull or miss the luxuries I am accustomed to. &lsquo;Do
      you know I&rsquo;m afraid Glory doesn&rsquo;t care so much for pinjane after all,&rsquo; I
      heard grandfather whispering to Aunt Anna one morning, and half an hour
      afterward he was reproving Aunt Rachel for pressing me too hard to serve
      at the soup kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They govern me like a child in pinafores, and of course like a child I
      revenge myself by governing all the house. But, oh, dear! oh, dear! gone
      are the days when I could live on water-gruel and be happy in a go-cart.
      Yes, the change is in me, not in them or the old home, and what&rsquo;s the good
      of putting back the clock when the sun is so stubbornly keeping pace? I
      might be happy enough at Glenfaba still, if I could only bring back the
      days when the garden trees were my gymnasium and I used to rock myself and
      sing like a bird on a bough in the wind, or when I led a band of boys to
      rob our own orchard&mdash;a bold deed, for which Bishop Anna ofttimes
      launched at me and! all her suffragans her severest censure&mdash;it was
      her slipper, I remember. But I can&rsquo;t run barefoot all day long on the wet
      sand now, with the salt spray blowing in my face, and a young lady of
      one-and-twenty seldom or never rushes out to play dumps and baggy-mug in
      public with little girls of ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a result, my former adventures are now limited to careering on the
      back of little &lsquo;Caesar,&rsquo; who has grown so ancient and fat that he waddles
      like an old duck, and riding him is like working your passage. So I
      confine myself to sitting on committees, and being sometimes sat upon, and
      rubbing the runes for grandfather, and cleaning the milkpails for Aunt
      Anna, and even such holy kill-times as going to church regularly and
      watching Neilus when he is passing round the plate after &lsquo;Let your light
      so shine before men&rsquo;&mdash;light to his practical intellect being clearly
      a synonym for silver in the shape of threepenny bits!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, oh my! oh my! I am a dark character in this place for all that The
      dear old goodies have never yet said a syllable about my letter announcing
      that I had gone over to the enemy (i. e., Satan and the music hall), and
      there is a dead hush in the house as often as the wind of conversation
      veers in that direction. This is nothing, though, to the white awe in the
      air when visitors call and I am questioned how I earn my living in London.
      I hardly know whether to laugh or cry at the long-drawn breath of relief
      when I wriggle out of a tight place without telling a lie. But you can&rsquo;t
      hide an eel in a sack, and I know the truth will pop out one of these
      days. Only yesterday I went district-visiting with Aunt Rachel, and one of
      the Balaams of life, who keeps a tavern for fishermen, lured us into his
      bar parlour to look at a portrait of &lsquo;Gloria&rsquo; which he had cut out of an
      illustrated paper and pinned up on the wall &lsquo;because it resembled me so
      much!&rsquo; Oh, dear! oh, dear! I could have found it in my heart to brazen it
      out on the spot at this sight of my evil fame; but when I saw poor little
      auntie watching me with fearful eyes I talked away like a mill-wheel and
      went out thanking God that the rest of the people of Peel were not as
      other men are, or even as this publican.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been getting newspapers myself, though, sent by my friend Rosa;
      and as long as the mis-reporters concerned themselves with my own doings
      and failures to do, and lied as tenderly as an epitaph about my
      disappearance from London, I cut them up and burned them. But when they
      forgot me, and began to treat of other people&rsquo;s triumphs, I made Neilus my
      waste-paper basket, on the understanding that the papers were to go to the
      fishermen just home from Kinsale. Then from time to time he told me they
      were &lsquo;goin&rsquo; round, miss, goin&rsquo; round,&rsquo; and gave me other assurances of
      &lsquo;the greatest circulation in the world,&rsquo; which was true enough certainly,
      though the old thief omitted to say it was at the paper-mill, where they
      were being turned into pulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, heigho! I don&rsquo;t need newspapers to remind me of London. Like St.
      Paul, I have a devil that beats me with fists, and as often as a clear day
      comes, and one can see things a long way off, he makes me climb to the top
      of Slieu Whallin [* A mountain in Man.] that I may sit on the beacon by
      the hour and strain my eyes for a glimpse of England, feeling like Lot&rsquo;s
      wife when she looked back on her old home, and then coming down with a
      heavy heart and a taste of tears in my mouth as if I had been turned into
      a pillar of salt. Dear old London! But I suppose it is going on its way
      just as it used to do, with its tides of traffic and its crowds and
      carriages, and wandering merchants and hawkers crying their wares, and
      everything the same as ever, just the same, although Glory isn&rsquo;t there!&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;10.30 P. M.&mdash;I had to interrupt the writing of my letter this
      morning owing to an alarm of illness seizing grandfather. He had been
      taken with a sudden faintness. Of course we sent for the doctor, but
      before he arrived the faintness had passed, so he looked wise at us, like
      a prize riddle which had to be guessed before his next visit, left us his
      autograph (a wonderful hieroglyphic), and went away. Since then
      grandfather has been in the hands of a less taciturn practitioner, whom he
      calls the &lsquo;flower of Glenfaba&rsquo; (that&rsquo;s me), and after talking nonsense to
      him all day and playing chess with him all the evening I have to put him
      to bed laughing, and come back to my own room to finish my letter with an
      easier mind. For the last half-hour the aurora has been pulsing in the
      northern sky, and I have been thinking that the glorious phantasmagoria
      must be the sign of a gale in heaven, just as sleet and mist and black
      wind are the signs of a gale on earth. But it has tripped off into
      nothingness and only the dark night is left, through which the dogs at
      Knockaloe are keeping up their private correspondence with the dogs at
      Ballamoar by the medium of their nightly howls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! Only 10.30! And to know that while we are going to bed by
      country hours, with nearly everything still and dead around us, London is
      just beginning to bestir itself! When I lie down and try to sleep I shall
      see the wide squares, with their statues of somebody inside, and the blaze
      of lights over the doors of the theatres, and all the tingling life of the
      great and wonderful city. Ugh! It makes one feel like one&rsquo;s own ghost
      wandering through the upper rooms and across the dark landings, and
      hearing the strains of the music and the sounds of the dancing from the
      ballroom below stairs!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my goodness! (I can still swear on that, you see, and not be
      forsworn!) &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the odds if you&rsquo;re jolly?&mdash;and I allus is!&rsquo; How&rsquo;s
      your dog? Mine would write you a letter, only her heart is moribund, and
      if things go on as they are going she must set about making her will. In
      fact, she is now lying at the foot of my bed thinking matters out, and
      bids me tell you that after various attempts to escape Home Rule, not
      being (like her mistress) one of those natures made perfect through
      suffering, she is only &lsquo;kept alive by the force of her own volition,&rsquo; in
      this house that is full of old maids and has nothing better in it than one
      old cat, and he isn&rsquo;t worth hunting, being destitute of a tail. Naturally
      she is doing her best (like somebody else) to keep herself unspotted from
      that world which is a source of so much temptation, but she&rsquo;s bound to
      confess that a little &lsquo;divilment&rsquo; now and then would help her to take a
      more holy and religious view of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;wish you happy&rsquo; in your new enterprise; but if you are going in for
      being the champion of woman in this world&mdash;of her wrongs&mdash;I warn
      you not to be too pointed in your moral, for there is a story here of a
      handsome young curate who was so particular in the pulpit with &lsquo;Lovest
      thou me&rsquo; that a lady followed him into the vestry and admitted that she
      did. Soberly, it is a great and noble effort, and I&rsquo;ve half a mind to love
      you for it. If men want women to be good they <i>will</i> be good, for
      women dance to the tune that men like best, and always have done so since
      the days of Adam&mdash;not forgetting that gentleman&rsquo;s temptation, nor yet
      his excuse about &lsquo;the woman <i>Thou gavest</i> me,&rsquo; which shows he wasn&rsquo;t
      much of a husband anyway, though certainly he hadn&rsquo;t much choice of a
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love to dear old London! Sometimes I have half a mind to skip off and
      do my wooing myself. Perhaps I should do so, only that Rosa writes that
      she would like to come and spend her summer holiday in Peel. Haven&rsquo;t I
      told you about Rosa? She&rsquo;s the lady journalist that Mr. Drake introduced
      me to.

    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;IMPORTANT. Ever since I left London I have been tormented with
      the recollection of poor Polly&rsquo;s baby. She put him out to nurse with the
      Mrs. Jupe you heard of, and that person put him out to somebody else.
      While the mother lived I had no business to interfere, but I can&rsquo;t help
      thinking of the motherless mite now and wondering what has become of him.
      I suppose that like Jeshurun he waxeth fat and kicketh by this time, yet

    <h2>
      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was on a Saturday morning that John Storm received Glory&rsquo;s letter, and
      on the evening of the same day he set out in search of Mrs. Jupe&rsquo;s. The
      place was not easy to find, and when he discovered it at length he felt a
      pang at the thought that Glory herself had lived in this dingy burrowing.
      As he was going up to the door of the little tobacco shop a raucous voice
      within was saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s doo on the byeby, and till you can py up
      you needn&rsquo;t be a-kemmin&rsquo; &lsquo;ere no more.&rdquo; At the next moment a young woman
      crossed him on the threshold. She was a little slender thing, looking like
      a flower that has been broken by the wet. He recognised her as the girl
      who had nursed the baby in Cook Lane on the day of his first visit to
      Soho. She was crying, and to hide her swollen eyes she dropped her head at
      passing, and he saw her faded ribbons and soiled straw hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman of middle age behind the counter was curtsying to his clerical
      attire, and a little girl at the door of an inner room was looking at him
      out of the corner of her eyes, with head aslant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Storm, I think, sir. Come in and set you down, sir.&mdash;Mind the
      shop, Booboo.&mdash;My &lsquo;usband &lsquo;as told me about ye, sir. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll know &lsquo;im
      at onct, Lidjer,&rsquo; &lsquo;e sez, siz &lsquo;e.&mdash;No, &lsquo;e ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;ome from the club
      yet, but &lsquo;e might be a-kemmin&rsquo; in any time now, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had seated himself in the little dark parlour, and was looking
      round and thinking of Glory. &ldquo;No matter; my business is with you, Mrs.
      Jupe,&rdquo; he answered, and at that the twinkling eyes and fat cheeks, which
      had been doing their best to smile, took on a look of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the metter?&rdquo; she asked, and she closed the door to the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I trust, my good woman,&rdquo; and then he explained his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jupe listened attentively and seemed to be asking herself who had
      sent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor young mother is dead now, as you may know, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the father ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the woman sharply, &ldquo;and, begging your
      parding, sir, if &lsquo;e wants ter know where the byeby is &lsquo;e can come &lsquo;isself
      and not send sembody else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the child is well, my good woman, and well cared for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> well keered for, and it&rsquo;s gorn to a pusson I can trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what have you got to conceal? Tell me where it is, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me! If it&rsquo;s &lsquo;is child, and &lsquo;e wants it, let &lsquo;im py for it, and
      interest ep ter dite. Them swells is too fond of gettin&rsquo; parsons to pull
      their chestnuts out o&rsquo; the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you suppose I am here in the interests of the father, you are
      mistaken, I do assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow, you do, do yer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matters had reached this pass when the door opened and Mr. Jupe came in.
      Off went his hat with a respectful salutation, but seeing the cloud on his
      wife&rsquo;s face, he abridged his greeting. The woman&rsquo;s apron was at her eyes
      in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s gowin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; he asked. John Storm tried to explain, but the woman
      contented herself with crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this, don&rsquo;cher see, Father. My missis is that fond of
      childring, and it brikes &lsquo;er &lsquo;eart&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was the man a fool or a hypocrite?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jupe,&rdquo; said John, rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your wife has been carrying on
      an improper and illegal business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now stou thet, sir,&rdquo; said the man, wagging his head. &ldquo;I respects the
      Reverend Jawn Storm a good deal, but I respects Mrs. Lidjer Jupe a good
      deal more, and when it comes to improper and illegal bizniss&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down&rsquo;t mind &lsquo;im, &lsquo;Enery,&rdquo; said the wife, now weeping audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And down&rsquo;t you tyke on so, Lidjer,&rdquo; said the husband, and they looked as
      if they were about to embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm could stand no more. Going down the court he was thinking with
      a pang of Glory&mdash;that she had lived months in the atmosphere of that
      impostor&mdash;when somebody touched his arm in the darkness. It was the
      girl. She was still crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckerlec&rsquo; seeing you in Crook Lane, sir, the day we christened my
      byeby, and I waited, thinking p&rsquo;raps you could help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; said John, and walking by his side along the blank wall
      of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, the girl told her story. She lived in one room of
      the clergy-house at the back of his church. Having to earn her living, she
      had answered an advertisement in a Sunday paper, and Mrs. Jupe had taken
      her baby to nurse. It was true she had given up all claim to the child,
      but she could not help going to see it&mdash;the little one&rsquo;s ways were so
      engaging. Then she found that Mrs. Jupe had let it out to somebody else.
      Only for her &ldquo;friend&rdquo; she might never have heard of it again. He had found
      it by accident at a house in Westminster. It was a fearful place, where
      men went for gambling. The man who kept it had just been released from
      eighteen months&rsquo; imprisonment, and the wife had taken to nursing while the
      husband was in prison. She was a frightful woman, and he was a shocking
      man, and &ldquo;they knocked the children about cruel.&rdquo; The neighbours heard
      screams and slaps and moans, and they were always crying &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; She had
      wanted to take her own baby away, but the woman would not give it up
      because there were three weeks&rsquo; board owing, and she could not pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you take me to this house, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come round to the church after service to-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s tearful face glistened like April sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you help me to get my little girl? Oh, how good you are!
      Everybody is saying what a Father it is that&rsquo;s come to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
      stopped, then said quite soberly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get somebody to lend me a shawl to
      bring &lsquo;er &lsquo;ome in. People say they pawn everything, and perhaps the
      beautiful white perlice I bought for &lsquo;er ... Oh, I&rsquo;ll never let &lsquo;er out of
      my sight again, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, my girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agatha Jones,&rdquo; the girl answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock on Sunday night before they were ready to
      start on their errand. Meantime Aggie had done two turns at the foreign
      clubs, and John Storm had led a procession through Crown Street and been
      hit by a missile thrown by a &ldquo;Skeleton,&rdquo; whom he declined to give in
      charge. At the corner of the alley he stopped to ask Mrs. Pincher to wait
      up for him, and the girl&rsquo;s large eyes caught sight of the patch of plaster
      above his temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you want to go, sir?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to lose,&rdquo; he answered. The bloodhound was with him; he
      had sent home for it since the attempted riot.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked toward Westminster she told him where she had been, and
      what money she had earned. It was ten shillings, and that would buy so
      many things for baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow I&rsquo;ll get a cot for her&mdash;one of those wicker ones; iron is
      so expensive. She&rsquo;ll want a pair o&rsquo; socks too, and by-and-bye she&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave
      to be shortened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was thinking of Glory. He seemed to be retreading the steps of
      her life in London. The dog kept close at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll &lsquo;a bin a month away now, a month to-morrow. I wonder if she&rsquo;s
      grow&rsquo;d much&mdash;I wonder! It&rsquo;s wrong of people letting their childring
      go away from them. I&rsquo;ll never go out at nights again&mdash;not if I &lsquo;ave
      to tyke in sewin&rsquo; for the slop shops. See this?&rdquo; laughing nervously and
      showing a shawl that hung on her arm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to bring &lsquo;er &lsquo;ome in&mdash;the
      nights is so chill for a byeby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s heart was heavy at sight of these little preparations, but the
      young mother&rsquo;s face was radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went by the Abbey, under its forest of scaffolding, and, walking
      toward Millbank, dipped into the slums, that lie in the shadow of the dark
      prison, they passed soldiers from the neighbouring barracks going
      arm-in-arm with girls, and this made Aggie talk of her &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; and cry a
      little, saying it was a week since she had seen him, and she was afraid he
      must have &lsquo;listed. She knew he was rude to people sometimes, and she asked
      pardon for him, but he wasn&rsquo;t such a bad boy, after all, and he never
      knocked you about except when he was drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house they were going to was in Angel Court, and having its door only
      to the front, it was partly sheltered from observation. A group of women
      with their aprons over their heads stood talking in whispers at the
      corner. One of them recognised Aggie and asked if she had got her child
      yet, whereupon John stopped and made some inquiries. The goings-on at the
      house were scandalous. The men who went to it were the lowest of the low,
      and there was scarcely one of them who hadn&rsquo;t &ldquo;done time.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s name
      was Sharkey, and his wife was as bad as he was. She insured the children
      at seven pounds apiece, and &ldquo;Lawd love ye, sir, at that price the poor
      things is worth more dead nor alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie&rsquo;s face was becoming white, and she was touching John Storm&rsquo;s elbow
      as if pleading with him to come away, but he asked further questions. Yes,
      there were several children. A twelve-months&rsquo; baby, a boy, was fretful
      with his teething, and on Sunday nights, when the woman was wanted
      downstairs, she just put the poor darling to bed and locked the room. If
      you lived next door, you could hear his crying through the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agatha,&rdquo; said John, as they stepped up to the door, &ldquo;get us both into
      this house as best you can, then leave the rest to me.&mdash;Don, lie
      close!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie tapped at the door. A little slide in it was run back and a voice
      said, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aggie,&rdquo; the girl answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of Charlie&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and then the door was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      John crossed the threshold first, the dog followed him, the girl entered
      last. When the door had closed behind them, the doorkeeper, a young man
      holding a candle in his hand, was staring at John with his whole face
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Not a word!&mdash;Don, watch that man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked at the dog and turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Sharkey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Downstairs, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were sounds of men&rsquo;s voices from below, and from above there came
      the convulsive sobs of a child, deadened as by a door between.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man gave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak or stir, or else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John glanced at the dog, and the man trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come upstairs, child,&rdquo; and the girl followed him to the upper floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the room in which the baby was crying they tried the door. It
      was locked. John attempted to force it, but it would not yield. The
      child&rsquo;s sobs were dying down to a sleepy moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another room stood open and they went in. It was the living-room. A kettle
      on the fire was singing and puffing steam. There was no sign of a key
      anywhere. Only a table, some chairs, a disordered sofa, certain sporting
      newspapers lying about, and a few pictures on the walls. Some of the
      pictures were of race-horses, but all the rest were memorial cards, and
      one bore the text, &ldquo;He shall gather them in his arms.&rdquo; Aggie was
      shuddering as with cold, being chilled by some unknown fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go down to the cellar&mdash;there&rsquo;s no help for it,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the hall had not spoken or stirred. He was still gazing in
      terror on the bloodshot eyes looking out of the darkness. John gave the
      candle to the girl and began to go noiselessly downstairs. There was not a
      movement in the house now. Big Ben was striking. It was twelve o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment John Storm was midway down, and had full view of the
      den. It was a washing cellar with a coal vault going out of it under the
      street. Some fifteen or twenty men, chiefly foreigners, were gathered
      about a large table covered with green baize, on which a small lamp was
      burning. A few of the men were seated on chairs ranged about, the others
      were standing at the back in rows two deep. They were gambling. The game
      was faro. Rows of lucifer matches were laid on the table, half-crowns were
      staked on them, and cards were cut and dealt. Except the banker, a
      middle-aged man with the wild eye of the hard spirit-drinker, everybody
      had his face turned away from the cellar stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not smoke or drink, and they only spoke to each other when the
      stakes were being received or paid. Then they quarrelled and swore in
      English. After that there was a chilling and hideous silence, as if
      something awful were about to occur. The lamp cast a strong light on the
      table, but the rest of the room was darkened by patches of shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coal vault had been turned into a drinking-bar, and behind the counter
      there was a well-stocked stillage. In the depths of its shade a woman sat
      knitting. She had a gross red and white face, and in the arch above her
      was the iron grid in the pavement. Somebody on the street walked over it,
      causing a hollow sound as of soil falling on a coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was no coward, but a certain tremor passed over him on finding
      himself in this subterranean lurking-place of men who were as beasts. He
      stood a full minute unseen. Then he heard the woman say in a low hiss,
      &ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s mee-e-et!&rdquo; and he knew he had been observed. The men turned and
      looked at him, not suddenly, or all at once, but furtively, cautiously,
      slowly. The banker crouched at the table with an astonished face and tried
      to smuggle the cards out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      John stood calmly, his whole figure displaying courage and confidence. The
      group of men broke up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the &lsquo;coppers,&rsquo;&rdquo; said one. Nobody else
      spoke, and they began to melt away. They disappeared through a door at the
      back which led into a yard, for, like rats, the human vermin always have a
      second way out of their holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half a minute the cellar was nearly empty. Only the banker and the
      woman and one young man remained. The young man was Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cheer, myte?&rdquo; he said with an air of unconcern. &ldquo;Is it trecks ye
      want, sir? Here ye are then,&rdquo; and he threw a pack of cards at John&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that gel o&rsquo; yawn that&rsquo;s done this,&rdquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a got-up thing, is it?&rdquo; said Charlie, and stepping to the
      counter, he took up a drinking-glass, broke it at the rim; and holding its
      jagged edges outward, turned to use it as a weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had not yet spoken, but a magnetic instinct warned him. He
      whistled, and the dog bounded down. The young man threw his broken glass
      on the floor and cried to the keeper of the house: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir, you! First
      you know, the beast will be at yer throat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing Charlie&rsquo;s voice, Aggie was creeping down the stairs. &ldquo;Charlie!&rdquo;
       she cried. Charlie threw open his coat, stuck his fingers in the armholes
      of his waistcoat, said in a voice of hatred, passion, and rage, &ldquo;Go and
      pawn yourself!&rdquo; and then swaggered out at the back door. The keeper made
      show of following, but John Storm called on him to stop. The man looked at
      the dog and obeyed. &ldquo;Wot d&rsquo;ye want o&rsquo; me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want this girl&rsquo;s baby. That&rsquo;s the first thing I want. I&rsquo;ll tell you the
      rest afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s grimace was frightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone, sir. We&rsquo;ve lost it,&rdquo; said the woman, with a hideous
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That story will not pass with me, my good woman. Go upstairs and unlock
      the door! You too, my man, go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A minute later they were in a bedroom above. Three neglected children lay
      asleep on bundles of rags. One of twelve months&rsquo; old was in a wicker
      cradle, one of three years was in a wooden cot, and a younger child was in
      a bed. Aggie had come up behind, and stood by the door trembling and
      weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my girl, find your baby,&rdquo; said John, and the young mother hurried
      with eager eyes from the cradle to the cot and from the cot to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here it is,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;No&mdash;oh no, no!&rdquo; and she began to wring
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told yer so,&rdquo; said the woman, and with a wicked grin she pointed to a
      memorial card which hung on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie&rsquo;s child was dead and buried. Diarrhoea! The doctor at the dispensary
      had given a certificate of death, and Charlie had shared the insurance
      money. &ldquo;Wish to Christ it was ended!&rdquo; he had said. He had been drunk ever
      since.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl was stunned. She was no longer crying. &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! What
      shall I do?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s child is this?&rdquo; said John, standing over the wicker cradle. The
      little sufferer from inflamed gums had sobbed itself to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A real laidy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Mrs. Jupe told us to tyke great kear of
      it. The father is Lord something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor girl,&rdquo; said John, turning to Aggie, &ldquo;could you carry this child
      home for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; said the girl, but she wrapped the shawl about the child and
      lifted it up sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you down&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the man, putting himself on guard before the door.
      &ldquo;That child is worth &lsquo;undrids of pounds to me, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back, you brute!&rdquo; said John, and with the girl and her burden he
      passed out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front door stood open and the neighbourhood had been raised. Trollopy
      women in their under-petticoats and with their hair hanging about their
      necks were gathered at the end of the court. Aggie was crying again, and
      John pushed through the crowd without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went back by Broad Sanctuary, where a solitary policeman was pacing
      to and fro on the echoing pavement. Big Ben was chiming the half-hour
      after midnight. The child coughed like a sheep constantly, and Aggie kept
      saying, &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pincher, in her widow&rsquo;s cap and white apron, was waiting up for them,
      and John committed the child to her keeping. Then he said to Aggie, who
      was turning away, &ldquo;My poor child, you have suffered deeply, but if you
      will leave this man I will help you to begin life again, and if you want
      money I will find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he <i>is</i> a Father and no mistake!&rdquo; said Mrs. Pincher; but the
      girl only answered in a hopeless voice, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no money, and I
      don&rsquo;t want to begin life again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she crossed the court to her room in the tenement house they heard her
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Before going to bed that night John Storm wrote to Glory:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! Have got poor Polly&rsquo;s baby, so you may set your heart at ease
      about it. All the days of my life I have been thought to be a dreamer, but
      it is surprising what a man can do when he sets to work for somebody else!
      Your former landlady turns out to be the wife of my &lsquo;organ man,&rsquo; and it
      was pitiful to see the dear old simpleton&rsquo;s devotion to his bogus little
      baggage. I have lost him, of course, but that was unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was by help of another victim that I traced the child at last. She is
      a ballet girl of some sort, and it was as much as I could stand to see the
      poor young thing carrying Polly&rsquo;s baby, her own being dead and buried
      without a word said to her. Short of the grace of God she will go to the
      bad now. Oh, when will the world see that in dealing with the starved
      hearts of these poor fallen creatures God Almighty knows best how to do
      his own business? Keep the child with the mother, foster the maternal
      instinct, and you build up the best womanhood. Drag them apart, and the
      child goes to the dogs and the mother to the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Polly&rsquo;s baby is safely lodged with Mrs. Pincher, a dear old
      grandmotherly soul who will love it like her own, and all the way home I
      have been making up my mind to start baby-farming myself on fresh lines.
      He who wrongs the child commits a crime against the State. However low a
      woman has fallen, she is a subject of the Crown, and if she is a mother
      she is the Crown&rsquo;s creditor. These are my first principles, the
      application will come anon. Meantime you have given me a new career, a
      glorious mission! Thank God and Glory Quayle for it for ever and ever!
      Then&mdash;who knows?&mdash;perhaps you will come back and take it up
      yourself some day. When I think of the precious time I spent, in that
      monastery ... but no, only for that I should not be here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, life is wonderful! But I feel afraid that I shall wake up&mdash;perhaps
      in the streets somewhere&mdash;and find I have been dreaming. Deeply
      grieved to hear of the grandfather&rsquo;s attack. Trust it has passed. But if
      not, certain I am that all is well with him and that he is staid only on
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope you are well and plodding through this wilderness in comfort,
      avoiding the thorns as well as you can. Glenfaba may be dull, but you do
      well to keep out of the whirlpool of London for the present. Yours is a
      snug spot, and when storms are blowing even the sea-gulls shelter about
      your house, I remember ... But why Rosa? Is Peel the only place for a
      summer holiday?&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Glenfaba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear John Storm, is it coals of fire you are heaping on my head,
      or fire of brimstone? Your last letter with its torrents of enthusiasm
      came sweeping down on me like a flood. What work you are in the midst of!
      What a life! What a purpose! While I&mdash;I am lying here like an old
      slipper thrown up oil the sea-beach. Oh, the pity oft, the pity oft! It
      must be glorious to be in the rush and swirl of all this splendid effort,
      whatever comes of it! One&rsquo;s soul is thrilled, one&rsquo;s heart expands! As for
      me, the garden of my mind is withering, and I am consuming the seed I
      ought to sow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosa has come. She has been here a month nearly, and is just charming,
      say what you will. Her thoughts have the dash of the great world, and I
      love to hear her talk. True, she troubles me sometimes, but that&rsquo;s only my
      envy and malice and all uncharitableness. When she tells of Betty-this and
      Ellen-that, and their wonderful successes and triumphs, I&rsquo;m the meanest
      sinner that crawls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny to see how the old folk bear themselves toward her. Aunt
      Rachel regards her as a sort of an artist, and is clearly afraid that she
      will break out into madness in spots somewhere. Aunt Anna disapproves of
      her hair, which is brushed up like a man&rsquo;s, and of her skirt, which &lsquo;would
      be no worse if it were less like a pair of breeches,&rsquo; for she has brought
      her &lsquo;bike.&rsquo; She talks on dangerous subjects also, and nobody did such
      things in auntie&rsquo;s young days. Then she addresses the old girlies as I do,
      and calls grandfather &lsquo;G-rand-dad,&rsquo; and like the witch of Endor generally,
      is possessed of a familiar spirit. Of course I give her various warning
      looks from time to time lest the fat should be in the fire, but she&rsquo;s a
      woman, bless her! and it&rsquo;s as true as ever it was that a woman can keep
      the secret she doesn&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the ideal of womanhood has changed since the old aunties were young;
      but when I listen to Rosa and then look over at Rachel with her black
      ringlets, and at Anna with her old-fashioned &lsquo;front,&rsquo; I shudder and ask
      myself, &lsquo;Why do I struggle?&rsquo; What is the reward if one gives up the
      fascination of life and the world? There is no reward. Nothing but
      solitary old-maidism, unless two of you happen to be sisters, for who else
      will join her shame to yours? Dreams, dreams, only dreams of the dearest
      thing that ever comes into a woman&rsquo;s arms&mdash;and then you awake and
      there is no one there. A dame&rsquo;s school, when the old father is gone, but
      no children of your own to love you, nobody to think of you, scraping a
      little here, pinching a little there, growing older and smaller year by
      year, looking yellow and craned like an apple that has been kept on the
      top shelf too long, and then&mdash;the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m trying so hard, so very hard, to be &lsquo;true to the higher self
      in me,&rsquo; because somebody says I must. What do you think I did last week?
      In my character of Lady Bountiful I gave an old folks&rsquo; supper in the soup
      kitchen, understood to be in honour of my return. Roast beef and plum
      duff, not to speak of pipes and &lsquo;baccy, and forty old people of both sexes
      sitting down to &lsquo;the do.&rsquo; After supper there was a concert, when Chaise
      (the fat old thief!) overflowed the &lsquo;elber&rsquo; chair, and alluded to me as
      &lsquo;our beautiful donor,&rsquo; and lured me into singing Mylecharaine, and leading
      the company, when we closed with the doxology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But &lsquo;it was not myself at all, Molly dear, &lsquo;twas my shadow on the wall,&rsquo; 
      and in any case man can&rsquo;t live by soup kitchens alone&mdash;nor woman
      either. And knowing what a poor, weak, vain woman I am at the best, I ask
      myself sometimes would it not be a thousand times better if I yielded to
      my true nature instead of struggling to realize a bloodless ideal that is
      not me in the least, but only my picture in the heart of some one who
      thinks me so much better than I am?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that anybody ever sees what a hypocrite I can be, though I came near
      to letting the cat out of the bag as lately as last night. You must know
      that when I turned my back on London at the command of John Knox the
      second, I brought all my beautiful dresses along with me, except such of
      them as were left at the theatre. Yet I daren&rsquo;t lay them out in the
      drawers, so I kept them under lock and key in my boxes. There they lurked
      like evil spirits in ambush, and as often as their perfume escaped into
      the room my eyes watered for another sight of them! But in spite of all
      temptation I resisted, I conquered, I triumphed&mdash;until last night
      when Rosa talked of Juliet, what a glorious creature she was, and how
      there was nobody on the stage who could &lsquo;look&rsquo; her and &lsquo;play&rsquo; her too!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think I did? Shall I tell you? Yes, I will. I crept upstairs
      to my quiet little room, tugged the box from its hiding-place under the
      bed, drew out my dresses&mdash;my lovely, lovely brocades&mdash;and put
      them on! Then I spoke the potion speech, beginning in a whisper, but
      getting louder as I went on, and always looking at myself in the glass. I
      had blown out the candle, and there was no light in the room but the moon
      that was shining on my face, but I was glowing, my very soul was afire,
      and when I came to the end I drew myself up with eyes closed and head
      thrown back and heart that paused a beat or two, and said, &lsquo;<i>I</i>&mdash;<i>I</i>
      am Juliet, for I am a great actress!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! I could scream with laughter to think of what happened next!
      Suddenly I became aware of somebody knocking at my door (I had locked it)
      and of a thin voice outside saying fretfully: &lsquo;Glory, whatever is it?
      Aren&rsquo;t you well, Glory?&rsquo; It was the little auntie; and thinking what a
      shock she would have if I opened the door and she came upon this grand
      Italian lady instead of poor little me, I had to laugh and to make excuses
      while I smuggled off my gorgeous things and got back into my plain ones!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a narrow squeak; but I had a narrower one some days before. Poor
      grandfather! He regards Rosa as belonging to a superior race, and loves to
      ask her what she thinks of Glory. He has grown quite simple lately, and as
      soon as he thinks my back is turned he is always saying, &lsquo;And what is your
      opinion of my granddaughter, Miss Macquarrie?&rsquo; To which she answers,
      &lsquo;Glory is going to make your name immortal, Mr. Quayle.&rsquo; Then his eyes
      sparkle and he says, &lsquo;Do you think so?&mdash;do you really think so?&rsquo; 
      Whereupon she talks further balderdash, and the dear old darling smiles a
      triumphant smile!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I always notice that not long afterward his eyes look wet and his
      head hangs low, and he is saying to the aunties, with a crack in his
      voice: &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll go away again. You&rsquo;ll see she will. Her beauty and her
      talents belong to the world.&rsquo; And then I burst in on them and scold them,
      and tell them not to talk nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless he is beginning to regard Rosa with suspicion, as if she
      were a witch luring me away, and one evening last week we had to steal
      into the garden to talk that we might escape from his watchful eyes. The
      sun had set&mdash;there was the red glow behind the castle across the sky
      and the sea, and we were walking on the low path by the river under the
      fuchsia hedge that hangs over from the lawn, you know. Rosa was talking
      with her impetuous dash of the great career open to any one who could win
      the world in London, how there were people enough to help her on, rich men
      to find her opportunities, and even to take theatres for her if need be.
      And I was hesitating and halting and stammering: &lsquo;Yes, yes, if it were the
      <i>regular</i> stage ... who knows? ... perhaps it might not be opened to
      the same objections, ...&rsquo; when suddenly the leaves of the fuchsia rustled
      as with a gust of wind, and we heard footsteps on the path above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the grandfather, who had come out on Rachel&rsquo;s arm and overheard
      what I had said! &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Glory!&rsquo; he faltered, and then I heard him take his
      snuff and blow his nose as if to cover his confusion, thinking I was
      deceiving them and carrying on a secret intercourse. I hardly know what
      happened next, except that for the five minutes following &lsquo;the great
      actress&rsquo; had to talk with the tongues of men and angels (Beelzebub&rsquo;s) in
      order to throw dust in the dear old eyes and drive away their doubts. It
      was a magnificent performance, &lsquo;you go bail.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll never do the like of it
      again, though I had only one old man and one old maid and one young woman
      for audience. The house &lsquo;rose&rsquo; at me too, and the poor old grandfather was
      appeased. But when we were back indoors I overheard him saying: &lsquo;After all
      there&rsquo;s no help for it. She&rsquo;s dull with us&mdash;what wonder! We can&rsquo;t
      cage our linnet, Rachel, and perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t try. A song-bird came to
      cheer us, but it will fly away. We are only old folks, dear&mdash;it&rsquo;s no
      use crying.&rsquo; And on going to his room that night he closed his door and
      said his prayers in a whisper, that I might not hear him when he sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t left his bed since. I fear he never will More than once I have
      been on the point of telling him there is no reason to think the deluge
      would come if I <i>did</i>, go back to London; but I will never leave him
      now. Yet I wish Aunt Rachel wouldn&rsquo;t talk so much of the days when I went
      away before. It seems that every night, on his way to his own room, he
      used to step into my empty one and come out with his eyes dim and his lips
      moving. I am not naturally hard-hearted, but I can&rsquo;t love grandfather like
      that. Oh, the cruelty of life! ... I know it ought to be the other way
      about; ... but I can&rsquo;t help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same I could cry to think how short life is, and how little of it
      I can spare. &lsquo;Cling fast to me and hold me,&rsquo; my heart is always saying,
      but meantime London is calling to me, calling to me, like the sea, and I
      feel as if I were a wandering mermaid and she were my ocean home.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Later.&mdash;Poor, poor grandfather! I was interrupted in the writing of
      my letter this morning by another of those sudden alarms. He had fainted
      again, and it is extraordinary how helpless the aunties are in a case of
      illness. Grandfather knows it too; and after I had done all I could to
      bring him round, he opened his eyes and whispered that he had something to
      say to me alone. At that the poor old things left the room with tears of
      woe and a look of understanding. Then fetching a difficult breath he said,
      &lsquo;<i>You</i> are not afraid, Glory, are you?&rsquo; and I answered him &lsquo;No,&rsquo; 
      though my heart was trembling. And then a feeble smile struggled through
      the wan features of his drawn face, and he told me his attack was only
      another summons. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll soon die for good,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and you must be
      strong and brave, my child, for death is the common lot, and then what is
      there to fear?&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t try to contradict him&mdash;what was the good of
      doing that? And after he had spoken of the coming time he talked quietly
      of his past life, how he had weathered the storm for seventy odd years,
      and his Almighty Father was bringing him into harbour at last. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      pray for life any longer, Glory. Many a time I did so in the old days when
      I had to bring up my little granddaughter, but my task is over now, and
      after the day is done where is the tired labourer who does not lie down to
      his rest with a will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor has been and gone. There is no ailment, and nothing to be done
      or hoped. It is only a general failure and a sinking earthward of the poor
      worn-out body as the soul rises to the heaven that is waiting to receive
      it. What a pagan I feel beside him! And how glad I am that I didn&rsquo;t talk
      of leaving him again when he was on the eve of his far longer journey! I
      have sent the aunties to bed, but Rosa has made me promise to awaken her
      at four, that she may take her turn at his bedside.

      &ldquo;Next Morning.&mdash;Rosa relieved me during the night, and I came to my
      room and lay down in the dullness of the dawn. But now I am sorry that I
      allowed her to do so, for I did not sleep, and grandfather appears to have
      been troubled with dreams. I fancied he shuddered a little as I left them
      together, and more than once through the wall I heard him cry, &lsquo;Bring him
      back!&rsquo; in the toneless voice of one who is labouring under the terrors of
      a nightmare. But each time I heard Rosa comforting him, so I lay down
      again without going in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being stronger this morning, he has been propped up in bed writing a
      letter. When he called for the pens and paper I asked if I couldn&rsquo;t write
      it for him, but the old darling made a great mystery of the matter, and
      looked artful, and asked if it was usual to fight your enemy with his own
      powder and shot. Of course I humoured him and pretended to be mighty
      curious, though I think I know who the letter was written to, all the same
      that he kept the address side of the envelope hidden even when the front
      of it was being sealed. He sealed it with sealing-wax, and I held the
      candle while he did so, with his poor trembling fingers in danger from the
      light, and then I stamped it with my mother&rsquo;s pearl ring, and he smuggled
      it under the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since breakfast he has shown an increased inclination to doze, but there
      have been visits from the wardens and from neighbouring parsons, for a <i>locum
      tenens</i> has had to be appointed. Of course, they have all inquired
      where his pain is, and on being told that he has none, they have gone
      downstairs cackling and clucking and crowing in various versions of
      &lsquo;Praise God for that!&rsquo; I hate people who are always singing the doxology.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noon.&mdash;Condition unchanged, except that in the intervals of
      drowsiness his mind has wandered a little. He appears to live in the past.
      Looking at me with conscious eyes, he calls me &lsquo;Lancelot&rsquo;&mdash;my
      father&rsquo;s name. It has been so all the morning. One would think he was
      walking in a twilight land where he mistakes people&rsquo;s faces and the dead
      are as much alive as the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all think I am brave, oh, so brave! because I do not cry now, as
      everybody else does&mdash;even Aunt Anna behind her apron&mdash;although
      my tears can flow so easily, and at other times I keep them constantly on
      tap. But I am really afraid, and down at the bottom of my heart I am
      terrified. It is just as if <i>something</i> were coming into the house
      slowly, irresistibly, awfully, and casting its shadow on the floor
      already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found out the cause of his outcries in the night. Aunt Rachel says
      he was dreaming of my father&rsquo;s departure for Africa. That was twenty-two
      years ago, but it seems that the memory of the last day has troubled him a
      good deal lately. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember it?&rsquo; he has been saying. &lsquo;There were
      no railways in the island then, and we stood at the gate to watch the
      coach that was taking him away. He sat on the top and waved his red
      handkerchief. And when he had gone, and it was no use watching, we turned
      back to the house&mdash;you and Anna and poor, pretty young Elise. He
      never came back, and when Glory goes again she&rsquo;ll never come back either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the intervals of his semi-consciousness, when he mistakes me for my
      father, my wonderful bravery often fails me, and I find excuses for going
      out of the room. Then I creep noiselessly through the house and listen at
      half-open doors. Just now I heard him talking quite rationally to Rachel,
      but in a voice that seemed to speak inwardly, not outwardly, as before.
      &lsquo;She can&rsquo;t help it, poor child!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Some day she&rsquo;ll know what it
      is, but not yet, not until she has a child of her own. The race looks
      forward, not backward. God knew when he created us that the world couldn&rsquo;t
      go on without that bit of cruelty, and who am I that I should complain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer, and with a pain at my heart I ran in and
      cried, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never leave you, grandfather.&rsquo; But he only smiled and said,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not be keeping you long, Glory, I&rsquo;ll not be keeping you long,&rsquo; and
      then I could have died for shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening.&mdash;All afternoon he has been like a child, and everything
      present to his consciousness seems to have been reversed. The shadow of
      eternity appears to have wiped out time. When I have raised him up in bed
      he has delighted to think he was a little boy in his young mother&rsquo;s arms.
      Oh, sweet dream! The old man with his furrowed forehead and beautiful
      white head and all the heavy years rolled back! More than once he has
      asked me if he may play till bedtime, and I have stroked his wrinkled
      hands and told him &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; for I pretend to be his mother, who died, when
      she was old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the &lsquo;part&rsquo; is almost too much for me, and, lest I should break down
      under the strain of it, I am going out of his room constantly. I have just
      been into his study. It is as full as ever of his squeezes and rubbings
      and plaster casts and dusty old runes. He has spent all his life away back
      in the tenth century, and now he is going farther, farther....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m aweary, aweary! If anything happens to grandfather I shall soon
      leave this place; there will be nothing to hold me here any longer, and
      besides I could not bear the sight of these evidences of his gentle
      presence, so simple, so touching. But what a vain thing London is with all
      its vast ado&mdash;how little, how pitiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later.&mdash;It is all over! The curtain has fallen, and I am not crying.
      If I did cry it would not be from grief, but because the end was so
      beautiful, so glorious! It was at sunset, and the streamers of the sun
      were coming horizontally into the room. He awoke from a long drowsiness,
      and a serenity almost angelic overspread his face. I could see that he was
      himself once again. Death had led him back through the long years since he
      was a child, and he knew he was an old man and I a young woman. &lsquo;Have the
      boats gone yet?&rsquo; he asked, meaning the herring boats that go at sunset. I
      looked out and told him they were at the point of going. &lsquo;Let me see them
      sail,&rsquo; he said, so I slipped my arms about him and raised him until he was
      sitting up and could see down the length of the harbour and past the
      castle to the sea. The reflection of the sunlight was about his silvery
      old head, and over the damps and chills of death it made a radiance on his
      face like a light from heaven. There was hardly a breeze, and the boats
      were dropping down from their berths with their brown sails half set.
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the other way with me, Glory. I&rsquo;m coming in, not
      going out. I&rsquo;ve been beating to windward all my life, but I see the
      harbour on my lee-bow at last as plainly as I ever saw Peel, and now I&rsquo;m
      only waiting for the top of the tide and the master of the port to run up
      the flag!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then his head fell gently back on my arm and his lips changed colour, but
      his eyes did not close, and over his saintly face there passed a fleeting
      smile. Thus died a Christian gentleman&mdash;a simple, sunny, merry,
      happy, childlike creature, and of such are the kingdom of heaven.
    </p>

      <i>Parson Quayle&rsquo;s Letter.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear John: Before this letter reaches you, or perhaps along with it, you
      will receive the news that tells you what it is. I am &lsquo;in,&rsquo; John; I can
      say no more than that. The doctor tells me it may be now or then or at any
      time. But I am looking for my enlargement soon, and whether it comes
      to-morrow sunset or with to-day&rsquo;s next tide I leave myself in His hands in
      whose hands we all are. Well has the wise man said, &lsquo;The day of our death
      is better than the day of our birth, so with all good will, and what
      legacy of strength old age has left to me, I send you my last word and
      message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor old daughters are sorely stricken, but Glory is still brave and
      true, being, as she always was, a quivering bow of steel. People tell me
      that the poor mother is strong in the girl, and the spirit of the mother&rsquo;s
      race; but well I know the father&rsquo;s stalwart soul supports her; and I pray
      God that when my dark hour comes her loving and courageous arms may be
      around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That brings me to the object of my letter. This living will soon be
      vacant, and I am wondering who will follow in my feeble steps. It is a
      sweet spot, John! The old church does not look so ill when the sun shines
      on it, and in the summer-time this old garden is full of fruit and
      flowers. Did I ever tell you that Glory was born here? I never had another
      grandchild, and we were great comrades from the first. She was a wise and
      winsome little thing, and I was only an old child myself, so we had many a
      run and romp in these grounds together. When I try to think of the place
      without her it is a vain effort and a painful one; and even while she was
      away in your great and wicked Babylon, with its dangers and temptations,
      her little ghost seemed to lurk at the back of every bush and tree, and
      sometimes it would leap out on me and laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is months since I saw your father, but they tell me he has lately
      burned his bureau, making one vast bonfire of the gatherings of twenty
      years. That is not such ill news either; and maybe, now the great ado that
      worked such woe is put by and gone, he would rejoice to see you back at
      home, and open his hungering arms to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my eyes ache and my pen is shaking. Farewell! Farewell! Farewell! An
      old man leaves you his blessing, John. God grant that in his own good time
      we may meet in a blessed paradise, rejoicing in his gracious mercy, and
      all our sins forgiven!
    </p>

    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s letter and its inclosure fell on John Storm like rain in the face
      of a man on horseback&mdash;he only whipped up and went faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I find words,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;to express what I feel at your mournful
      news? Yet why mournful? His life&rsquo;s mission was fulfilled, his death was a
      peaceful victory, and we ought to rejoice that he was so easily released.
      I trust you will not mourn too heavily for him, or allow his death to stop
      your life. It would not be right. No trouble came near his stainless
      heart, no shadow of sin; his old age was a peaceful day which lasted until
      sunset. He was a creature that had no falsetto in a single fibre of his
      being, no shadow of affectation. He kept like this through all our
      complicated existence in this artificial world, absolutely unconscious of
      the hollowness and pretension and sham that surrounded him&mdash;tolerant,
      too, and kind to all. Then why mourn for him? He is gathered in&mdash;he
      is safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His letter was touching in its artful simplicity. It was intended to ask
      me to apply for his living. But my duty is here, and London must make the
      best of me. Yet more than ever now I feel my responsibility with regard to
      yourself. The time is not ripe to advise you. I am on the eve of a great
      effort. Many things have to be tried, many things attempted. It is a
      gathering of manna&mdash;a little every day. To God&rsquo;s keeping and
      protection meantime I commit you. Comfort your aunts, and let me know if
      there is anything that can be done for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ink of this letter was hardly dry when John Storm was in the middle of
      something else. He was in a continual fever now. Above all, his great
      scheme for the rescue and redemption of women and children possessed him.
      He called it Glory&rsquo;s scheme when he talked of it to himself. It might be
      in the teeth of nineteenth-century morality, but what matter about that?
      It was on the lines of Christ&rsquo;s teaching when he forgave the woman and
      shamed the hypocrites. He would borrow for it, beg for it, and there might
      be conditions under which he would steal for it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Callender shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I much misdoubt there&rsquo;ll be scandal, laddie. It&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s work, I&rsquo;m
      thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Be thou as chaste as ice,&rsquo; auntie, &lsquo;as pure as snow&rsquo; ... but no matter!
      I intend to call out the full power of a united Church into the warfare
      against this high wickedness. Talk of the union of Christendom! If we are
      in earnest about it we&rsquo;ll unite to protect and liberate our women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s the siller to come frae, laddie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere&mdash;everywhere! Besides, I have a bank I can always draw on,
      auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no meaning the Prime Minister again, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the King of Kings. God will provide for me, in this, as in
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus his reckless enthusiasm bore down everything, and at the back of all
      his thoughts was the thought of Glory. He was preparing a way for her; she
      was coming back to a great career, a glorious mission; her bright soul
      would shine like a star; she would see that he had been right, and
      faithful, and then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;But it was like wine coursing
      through his veins&mdash;he could not think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three thousand pounds had to be found to buy or build homes with, and he
      set out to beg for the money. His first call was at Mrs. Macrae&rsquo;s. Going
      up to the house, he met the lady&rsquo;s poodle in a fawn-coloured wrap coming
      out in charge of a footman for its daily walk round the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave the name of &ldquo;Father Storm,&rdquo; and after some minutes of waiting he
      was told that the lady had a headache and was not receiving that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say the nephew of the Prime Minister wishes to see her,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the footman had returned again there was the gentle rustle of a
      dress on the stairs, and the lady herself was saying: &ldquo;Dear Mr. Storm,
      come up. My servants are real tiresome, they are always confusing names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Time had told on her; she was looking elderly, and the wrinkles about her
      eyes could no longer be smoothed out. But her &ldquo;front&rdquo; was curled, and she
      was still saturated in perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of your return, dear Mr. Storm,&rdquo; she said, in the languid voice
      of the great lady, but the accent of St. Louis, as she led the way to the
      drawing-room. &ldquo;My daughter told me about it. She was always interested in
      your work, you know.... Oh, yes, quite well, and having a real good time
      in Paris. Of course, you know she has been married. A great loss to me
      naturally, but being God&rsquo;s will I felt it was my duty as a mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and then a pathetic description of her maternal sentiments, consoled by
      the circumstance that her son-in-law belonged to &ldquo;one of the best
      families,&rdquo; and that she was constantly getting newspapers from &ldquo;the other
      side&rdquo; containing full accounts of the wedding and of the dresses that were
      worn at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      John twirled his hat in his hand and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are your dear devoted people doing down there in Soho?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then John told of his work for working girls, and the great lady pretended
      to be deeply interested. &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;ll soon be better than the upper
      classes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      John thought it was not improbable, but he went on to tell of his scheme,
      and how small was the sum required for its execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only three thousand! That ought to be easily fixed up. Why, certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charity is the salt of riches, madam, and if rich people would remember
      that their wealth is a trust&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;I always do. &lsquo;Lay not up for yourselves treasure on earth&rsquo;&mdash;what
      a beautiful text <i>that</i> is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so, madam. So many Christian people allow that
      God is the God of the widow and fatherless, while the gods they really
      worship are the gods of silver and gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I love the dear children, and I like to go to the institution to see
      them in their nice white pinafores making their curtsies. But what you say
      is real true, Mr. Storm; and since I came from Sent Louis I&rsquo;ve seen
      considerable people who are that silly about cats&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then
      a long story of the folly of a lady friend who once had a pet Persian, but
      it died, and she wore crape for it, and you could never mention a cat in
      her hearing afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the poodle came back from its walk, and the lady called it
      to her, fondled it affectionately, said it was a present from her poor
      dear husband, and launched into an account of her anxieties respecting it,
      being delicate and liable to colds, notwithstanding the trousseau (it was
      a lady poodle) which the fashionable dog tailor in Regent Street had
      provided for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      John got up to take his leave. &ldquo;May I then count on your kind support on
      behalf of our poor women and children of Soho?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, of course, that matter&mdash;well, you see the Archdeacon kindly
      comes to talk &lsquo;City&rsquo; with me&mdash;in fact, I&rsquo;m expecting him to-day&mdash;and
      I never do anything without asking his advice, never, in my present state
      of health&mdash;I have a weak heart, you know,&rdquo; with her head aside and
      her saturated pocket-handkerchief at her nose. &ldquo;But has the Prime Minister
      done anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has advanced me two thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; rising and kicking back her train. &ldquo;Well, as I say, we ought to
      fix it right away. Why not hold a meeting in my drawing-room? All
      denominations, you say? I don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;not in a cause like that,&rdquo; and
      she glanced round her room as if thinking it was always possible to
      disinfect it afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody was coughing loudly in the hall as John stepped downstairs. It
      was the Archdeacon coming in. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a flourish of the
      hand, greeting John as if they had parted yesterday and on the best of
      terms. Yes, there <i>had</i> been changes, and he was promoted to a sphere
      of higher usefulness. True, his good friends had looked for something
      still higher, but it was the premier archdeaconry at all events, and in
      the Church, as in life generally, the spirit of compromise ruled
      everything. He asked what John was doing, and on being told he said, with
      a somewhat more worldly air, &ldquo;Be careful, my dear Storm, don&rsquo;t encourage
      vice. For my part, I am tired of the &lsquo;fallen sister.&rsquo; To tell you the
      truth, I deny the name. The painted Jezebel of the Piccadilly pavement is
      no sister of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t choose our relations, Archdeacon,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;If God is our
      Father, then all men are our brothers, and all women are our sisters
      whether we like it or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! The same man still, I see. But we will not quarrel about words. Seen
      the dear Prime Minister lately? Not <i>very</i> lately? Ah, well&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a superior smile&mdash;&ldquo;the air of Downing Street&mdash;it&rsquo;s so bad for
      the memory, they say,&rdquo; and coughing loudly again, he stepped upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm went home that day light-handed but with a heavy heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging is an ill trade on a fast day, laddie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Callender. &ldquo;Sit
      you down and tak&rsquo; some dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare these people pray, &lsquo;Our Father which art in heaven?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s
      blasphemy! It&rsquo;s deceit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, and they would deceive God about their dividends if he couldn&rsquo;t see
      into their safes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their money is the meanest thing Heaven gives them. If I asked them for
      their health or their happiness, Lord God, what would they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the Sunday night following John Storm preached to an overflowing
      congregation from the text, &ldquo;This people draweth nigh unto me with their
      mouth and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a few weeks afterward his face was bright and his voice was cheery,
      and he was writing another letter to Glory:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In full swing at last, Glory. To carry out my new idea I had to get three
      thousand pounds more of my mother&rsquo;s money from my uncle. He gave it up
      cheerfully, only saying he was curious to see what approach to the
      Christian ideal the situation of civilization permitted. But Mrs.
      Callender is <i>dour</i>, and every time I spend sixpence of my own money
      on the Church she utters withering sarcasms about being only a &lsquo;daft auld
      woman hersel&rsquo;,&rsquo; and then I have to caress and coax her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The newspapers were facetious about my &lsquo;Baby Houses&rsquo; until they scented
      the Prime Minister at the back of them, and now they call them the &lsquo;Storm
      Shelters,&rsquo; and christen my nightly processions &lsquo;The White-cross Army.&rsquo; 
      Even the Archdeacon has begun to tell the world how he &lsquo;took an interest&rsquo; 
      in me from the first and gave me my title. I met him again the other day
      at a rich woman&rsquo;s house, where we had only one little spar, and yesterday
      he wrote urging me to &lsquo;organize my great effort,&rsquo; and have a public dinner
      in honour of its inauguration. I did not think God&rsquo;s work could be well
      done by people dining in herds and drinking bottles of champagne, but I
      showed no malice. In fact, I agreed to hold a meeting in the lady&rsquo;s
      drawing-room, to which clergymen, laymen, and members of all denominations
      are being invited, for this is a cause that rises above all differences of
      dogma, and I intend to try what can be done toward a union of Christendom
      on a social basis. Mrs. Callender is dour on that subject too, reminding
      me that where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together.
      The Archdeacon thinks we must have the meeting before the twelfth of
      August, or not until after the middle of September, and Mrs. Callender
      understands this to mean that &lsquo;the Holy Ghost always goes to sleep in the
      grouse season.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime my Girls&rsquo; Club goes like a forest fire. We are in our renovated
      clergy-house at last, and have everything comfortable. Two hundred members
      already, chiefly dressmakers and tailors, and girls out of the jam and
      match factories. The bright, merry young things, rejoicing in their brief
      blossoming time between girlhood and womanhood. I love to be among them
      and to look at their glistening eyes! Mrs. Callender blows withering
      blasts on this head also, saying it is no place for a &lsquo;laddie,&rsquo; whereupon
      I lie low and think much but say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our great night is Sunday night after service. Yes, indeed, Sunday!
      That&rsquo;s just when the devil&rsquo;s houses are all open round about us, and why
      should God&rsquo;s house be shut up? It is all very well for the people who have
      only one Sabbath in the week to keep it wholly holy&mdash;I have seven,
      being a follower of Jesus, not of Moses. But the rector of the parish has
      begun to complain of my &lsquo;intrusion,&rsquo; and to tell the Bishop I ought to be
      &lsquo;mended or ended.&rsquo; It seems that my &lsquo;doings&rsquo; are &lsquo;indecent and
      unnecessary,&rsquo; and my sermons are &lsquo;a violation of all the sanctities, all
      the modesties of existence.&rsquo; Poor dumb dog, teaching the Gospel of Don&rsquo;t!
      The world has never been reformed by &lsquo;resignation&rsquo; to the evils of life,
      or converted by &lsquo;silence&rsquo; either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I wish you were here, in the midst of it all! And&mdash;who knows?&mdash;perhaps
      you will be some day yet. Do not trouble to answer this&mdash;I will write
      again soon, and may then have something practical to say to you. <i>Au
      revoir!</i>&rdquo;

      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the day of the drawing-room meeting a large company gathered in the
      hall at Belgrave Square. Lady Robert Ure, back from the honeymoon,
      received the guests for her mother, whose weak heart and a headache kept
      her upstairs. Her husband stood aside, chewing the end of his mustache and
      looking through his eyeglass with a gleam of amused interest in his
      glittering eye. There were many ladies, all fashionably dressed, and one
      of them wore a seagull&rsquo;s wing in her hat, with part of the root left
      visible and painted red to show that it had been torn out of the living
      bird. The men were nearly all clergymen, and the cut of their cloth and
      the fashions of their ties indicated the various complexions of their
      creeds. They glanced at each other with looks of embarrassment, and Mrs.
      Callender, who came in like a breeze off a Scottish moor, said audibly
      that she had never seen &ldquo;sae many craws on one tree before.&rdquo; The
      Archdeacon was there with his head up, talking loudly to Lady Robert. She
      stood motionless in her place, never turning her head toward John Storm,
      though it was plain that she was looking at him constantly. More than once
      he caught an expression of pain in her face, and felt pity for her as one
      of the brides who had acted the lie of marrying without love. But his
      spirits were high. He welcomed everybody, and even bantered Mrs. Callender
      when she told him she &ldquo;objected to the hale thing,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Weel, weel,
      wait a wee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Archdeacon gave the signal and led the way with Lady Robert to the
      drawing-room, where Mrs. Macrae, redolent of perfume, was reclining on a
      sofa with the &ldquo;lady poodle&rdquo; by her side. As soon as the company were
      seated the Archdeacon rose and coughed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have no assurance of a blessing
      except &lsquo;Ask and ye shall receive.&rsquo; Therefore, before we go further, it is
      our duty, as brethren of a common family in Christ, to ask the blessing of
      Almighty God on this enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a subdued rustle of drooping hats and bonnets, when suddenly a
      thin voice was heard to say, &ldquo;Mr. Archdeacon, may I inquire first who is
      to ask the blessing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of doing so myself,&rdquo; said the Archdeacon with a meek smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, as a Unitarian, I must object to an invocation in which I
      do not believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a half-suppressed titter from the wall at the back, where Lord
      Robert Ure was standing with his face screwed up to his eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if the name of our Lord is a stumbling block to our Unitarian,
      brother, no doubt the prayer in this instance would be acceptable without
      the customary Christian benediction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you,&rdquo; said a large man near the door, with whiskers all
      round his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been trimming all your life, and now you are going
      to trim away the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If our Low-Church brother thinks he can do better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John Storm intervened. He had looked icy cold, though the twitching of
      his lower lip showed that he was red hot within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said in a quavering voice, &ldquo;I apologize for
      bringing you together. I thought if we were in earnest about the union of
      Christendom we might at least unite in the real contest with evil. But I
      find it is a dream; we have only been trifling with ourselves, and there
      is not one of us who wants the union of Christendom, except on the
      condition that his rod shall be like Aaron&rsquo;s rod which swallowed up all
      the rest. It was a mistake, and I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the Archdeacon, &ldquo;it <i>was</i> a mistake; and if you had
      taken my advice from the first, and asked the blessing of God through good
      High Churchmen alone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God doesn&rsquo;t wait for any asking,&rdquo; said John, now flushing up to the eyes.
      &ldquo;He gives freely to High Churchmen, Low Churchmen, and No Churchmen
      alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is your opinion, sir, you are no better than some of your
      friends, and for my part I will never darken your door again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Darken</i> is a good word for it, Archdeacon,&rdquo; said John, and with
      that the company broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Macrae looked like a thunder-cloud as John bowed to her on passing
      out, but Mrs. Callender cried out in a jubilant voice, &ldquo;Be skipper of your
      ain ship, laddie!&rdquo; and added (being two yards behind the Archdeacon&rsquo;s
      broad back going down the stairs), &ldquo;If some folks are to be inheritors of
      the kingdom of heaven there&rsquo;ll be a michty crush at the pearly gates, I&rsquo;m
      thinking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm went back to Soho with a heavy heart. Going up Victoria Street
      he passed a crowd of ragged people who were ploughing their way through
      the carriages. Two constables were taking a man and woman to the police
      court in Rochester Row. The prisoners were Sharkey, the keeper of the
      gambling house, and his wife the baby-farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But within a week John Storm, in greater spirits than ever, was writing to
      Glory again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Archdeacon has deserted me, but no matter! My uncle has advanced me
      another thousand of my mother&rsquo;s money, so the crusade is <i>self</i>-supporting
      in one sense at all events. What a fool I am! Ask Aunt Anna her opinion of
      me, or say old Chalse or the village natural&mdash;but never mind! Folly
      and wisdom are relative terms, and I don&rsquo;t envy the world its narrow ideas
      of either. You would be amused to see how the women of the West End are
      taking up the movement&mdash;Lady Robert Ure among the rest! They have
      banded themselves into a Sisterhood, and christened our clergy-house a
      &lsquo;Settlement.&rsquo; One of my Greek owners came in the other evening to see the
      alterations. His eyes glistened at the change, and he asked leave to bring
      a friend. I trust you are well and settling things comfortably, and that
      Miss Macquarrie has gone. It is raining through a colander here, but I
      have no time to think of depressing weather. Sometimes when I cross our
      great squares, where the birds sing among the yellowing leaves, my mind
      goes off to your sweet home in the sunshine; and when I drop into the dark
      alleys and lanes, where the pale-faced children play in their poverty and
      rags, I think of a day that is coming, and, God willing, is now so near,
      when a ministering angel of tenderness and strength will be passing
      through them like a gleam. But I am more than ever sure that you do well
      to avoid for the present the pompous joys of life in London, where for one
      happy being there are a thousand pretenders to happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the Sunday night following, Crook Lane, outside the clergy-house, was
      almost blocked with noisy people of both sexes. They were a detachment of
      the &ldquo;Skeletons,&rdquo; and the talk among them was of the trial of the Sharkeys,
      which had taken place the day before. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ed six menths,&rdquo; said one.
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all along o&rsquo; minjee parsons,&rdquo; said another; and Charlie Wilkes,
      who had a certain reputation for humour, did a step-dance and sang some
      doggerel beginning&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Father Storm is a werry good man,
  &lsquo;E does you all the &lsquo;arm &lsquo;e can.
</pre>
    <p>
      Through this crowd two gentlemen pushed their way to the clergy-house,
      which was brilliantly lit up. One of them was the Greek owner, the other
      was Lord Robert Ure. Entering a large room on the ground floor, they first
      came upon John Storm, in cassock and biretta, standing at the door and
      shaking hands with everybody who came in and went out. He betrayed no
      surprise, but greeted them respectfully and then passed them on. Every
      moment of his time was occupied. The room was full of the young girls of
      the district, with here and there a Sister out of another world entirely.
      Some were reading, some conversing, some laughing, some playing a piano,
      and some singing. Their voices filled the air like the chirping of birds,
      and their faces were bright and happy. &ldquo;Good-evening, Father,&rdquo; they said
      on entering, and &ldquo;Good-night, Father,&rdquo; as they went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men stood some minutes and looked round the room. It was observed
      that Lord Robert did not remove his hat. He kept chewing the end of a
      broken cigarette, whereof the other end hung down his chin. One of the
      Sisters heard him say, &ldquo;It will do with a little alteration, I think.&rdquo;
       Then he went off alone, and the Greek owner stepped up to John Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not at first that John could attend to him, and when he was able to
      do so he began to rattle on about his own affairs. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he said with a
      delighted smile and a wave of the arm, &ldquo;see how crowded we are! We&rsquo;ll have
      to think of taking in the next door soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Storm,&rdquo; said the Greek, &ldquo;I have something serious to say, though
      the official notification will of course reach you by another channel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s face darkened as a ripe cornfield does when the sun dies away from
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to tell you that the trustees, having had a favourable offer
      for this property&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; His great staring eyes had stopped the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;have decided to sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sell</i>? Did you say se&mdash;&mdash;? To whom? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, to the syndicate of a music hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John staggered back, breathing audibly. &ldquo;Now if a man had to believe that&mdash;Do
      you know if I thought such a thing <i>could</i> happen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you take the matter so seriously, Father Storm. It&rsquo;s true
      you&rsquo;ve spent money on the property, but, believe me, the trustees will
      derive no profit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Profit? Money? Do you suppose I&rsquo;m thinking of that, and not of the
      desecration, the outrage, the horror? But who are they? Is that man&mdash;Lord&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Greek had nodded his head, and John flung open the door. &ldquo;Out of this!
      Out of it, you Judas!&rdquo; And almost before the Greek had crossed the
      threshold the door was banged at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident had been observed, and there was dead silence in the
      club-room, but John only cried, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sing something, girls,&rdquo; and when a
      Sister struck up his favourite Nazareth there was no voice so loud as his.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had realized everything. &ldquo;Gloria&rdquo; was coming back, and the work of
      months was overthrown!
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was going home groups of the girls were talking in whispers in the
      hall, and Mrs. Pincher, who was wiping her eyes at the door, said, &ldquo;I
      wonder you don&rsquo;t drown yourself&mdash;I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the corner of the lane Mr. Jupe was waiting for him to beg his pardon
      and to ask his advice. What he had said of Mrs. Jupe had turned out to be
      true. The Sharkeys had &ldquo;split&rdquo; on her and she had been arrested. &ldquo;It was
      all in the evenin&rsquo; pipers last night,&rdquo; the weak creature whimpered, &ldquo;and
      to-day my manager told me I &lsquo;ad best look out for another place. Oh, my
      poor Lidjer! What am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? Cut her off like a rotten bough!&rdquo; said John scornfully, and with that
      he strode down the street. The human sea roared around him, and he felt as
      if he wanted to fling himself into the midst of it and be swallowed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Victoria Square he told Mrs. Callender the news&mdash;flung it
      out at her with a sort of triumphant shout. His church had been sold over
      his head, and being only &ldquo;Chaplain to the Greek-Turks,&rdquo; he was to be
      turned into the streets. Then he laughed wildly, and by some devilish
      impulse began to abuse Glory. &ldquo;The next chaplain is to be a girl,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;one of those creatures who throw kisses at gaping crowds and sweep
      curtsies for their dirty crusts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all at once he turned white as a ghost and sat down trembling. Mrs.
      Callender&rsquo;s face was twitching, and to prevent herself from crying she
      burst into scorching satire. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, sitting in her
      rocking-chair and rocking herself furiously, &ldquo;I ken&rsquo;d weel what it would
      come til! Adversity mak&rsquo;s a man wise, they say, if it doesna mak&rsquo; him
      rich. But it&rsquo;s the Prime Minister I blame for this. The auld dolt! he must
      be fallen to his dotage. It&rsquo;s enough to mak&rsquo; a reasonable body go out of
      her mind to think of sic wise asses. I told you what to expect, but you
      were always miscalling me for a suspicious auld woman. Oh, it&rsquo;s a thing
      ye&rsquo;d no suspect; but Jane Callender is only a daft auld fool, ye see, and
      doesna ken what she&rsquo;s saying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at the next moment she had jumped up and flung her arms about John&rsquo;s
      neck, and was crying over him like a girl. &ldquo;Oh, my son! my ain son! And is
      it for me to fling out at ye? Aye, aye, it&rsquo;s a heartless world, laddie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed the old woman, and then she tried to coax him to eat. &ldquo;Come,
      come, a wee bittie, just a wee bittie. We must eat our supper anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God seems dead and heaven a long way off!&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a drap o&rsquo; whisky will do no harm&mdash;a wee drappie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing clear&mdash;God sees I&rsquo;m unfit for the work, so he
      has taken it away from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned aside from the table, and the supper was left untouched.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first post next morning brought a letter from Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Garden House,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clement&rsquo;s Inn, W. C.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! I have returned to town! I couldn&rsquo;t help it, I couldn&rsquo;t, I
      couldn&rsquo;t! London dragged me back. What was I to do after everything was
      settled and the aunties provided for?&mdash;assist in a dame&rsquo;s school and
      wage war with pothooks and hangers? Oh! I was dying of weariness&mdash;dying,
      dying, dying!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then they made me such tempting offers. Not the music hall&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      think that. I dare say you were quite right there. No, but the theatre,
      the regular theatre! Mr. Drake has bought some broken-down old place, and
      is to turn it into a beautiful theatre expressly for me. I am to play
      Juliet. Only think&mdash;Juliet!&mdash;and in my own theatre! Already I
      feel like a liberated slave who has crossed her Red Sea.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A fortnight had passed, and John Storm had not yet visited Glory.
      Nevertheless, he had heard of her from day to day through the medium of
      the newspapers. Every morning he had glanced down the black columns for
      the name that stood out from them as if its letters had been printed in
      blood. The reports had been many and mysterious. First, the brilliant
      young artiste, who had made such an extraordinary impression some months
      before, had returned to London and would shortly resume the promising
      career which had been interrupted by illness and family bereavement. Next,
      the forthcoming appearance would be on the regular stage, and in a
      Shakespearian character, which was always understood to be a crucial test
      of histrionic genius. Then, the revival of Romeo and Juliet, which had
      formerly been in contemplation, would probably give way to the still more
      ambitious project of an entirely new production by a well-known
      Scandinavian author, with a part peculiarly fitted to the personality and
      talents of the <i>débutante</i>. Finally, a syndicate was about to be
      formed for the purchase of some old property, with a view to its
      reconstruction as a theatre, in the interests of the new play and the new
      player.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm laughed bitterly. He told himself that Glory was unworthy of
      the least of his thoughts. It was his duty to go on with his work and
      think of her no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had received his official notice to quit. The church was to be given up
      in a month, the clergy-house in two months, and he believed himself to be
      immersed in preparations for the rehousing of the club and home. Twenty
      young mothers and their children now lived in the upper rooms, under
      obedience to the Sisterhood, but Polly&rsquo;s boy had remained with Mrs.
      Pincher. From time to time he had seen the little one tethered to a chair
      by a scarf about its waist, creeping by the wall to the door, and there
      gazing out on the world with looks of intelligence, and babbling to it in
      various inarticulate noises. &ldquo;Boo-loo! Lal-la! Mum-um!&rdquo; The little dark
      face had the eyes of its mother, but it represented Glory for all that.
      John Storm loved to see it. He felt that he could never part with it, and
      that if Lord Robert Ure himself came and asked for it he would bundle him
      out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a carriage drew up at Mrs. Callender&rsquo;s one morning, and Lady Robert
      Ure stepped out. Her pale and patient face had the feeble and nervous
      smile of the humiliated and unloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Storm,&rdquo; she said in her gentle voice, &ldquo;I have come on a delicate
      errand. I can not delay any longer a duty I ought to have discharged
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was about Polly&rsquo;s baby. She had heard of what had happened at the
      hospital; and the newspapers which had followed her to Paris, with reports
      of her wedding, had contained reports of the girl&rsquo;s death also. Since her
      return she had inquired about the child, and discovered that it had been
      rescued by him and was now in careful keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is for me to look after it, Mr. Storm, and I beg of you to give it
      up to me. Something tells me that God will never give me children of my
      own, so I shall be doing no harm to any one, and my husband need never
      know whose child it is I adopt. I promise you to be good to it. It shall
      never leave me. And if it should live to be a man, and grow to love me,
      that will help me to forget the past and to forgive myself for my own
      share in it. Oh, it is little I can do for the poor girl who is gone&mdash;for,
      after all, she loved him and I took him from her. But this is my duty, Mr.
      Storm, and I can not sleep at night or rest in the day until it is begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it is your duty, dear lady, but if you wish for the child
      it is your right,&rdquo; said John Storm, and they got into the carriage and
      drove to Soho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boo-loo! Lal-la! Mum-um!&rdquo; The child was tethered to the chair as usual
      and talking to the world according to its wont. When it was gone and the
      women on the doorsteps could see no more of the fine carriage of the great
      lady who had brought the odour of perfume and the rustle of silk into the
      dingy court, and Mrs. Pincher had turned back to the house with red eyes
      and her widow&rsquo;s cap awry, John Storm told himself that everything was for
      the best. The last link with Glory was broken! Thank God for that! He
      might go on with his work now and need think of her no more!
    </p>
    <p>
      That day he called at Clement&rsquo;s Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Garden House was a pleasant dwelling, fronting on two of its sides to
      the garden of the ancient Inn of Chancery, and cosily furnished with many
      curtains and rugs. The Cockney maid who answered the door was familiar in
      a moment, and during the short passage from the hall to the floor above
      she communicated many things. Her name was Liza; she had heard him preach;
      he had made her cry; &ldquo;Miss Gloria&rdquo; had known her former mistress, and Mr.
      Drake had got her the present place.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of laughter from the drawing-room. It was Glory&rsquo;s voice.
      When the door opened she was standing in the middle of the floor in a
      black dress and with a pale face, but her eyes were bright and she was
      laughing merrily. She stopped when John Storm entered and looked confused
      and ashamed. Drake, who was lounging on the couch, rose and bowed to him,
      and Miss Macquarrie, who was correcting long slips of printer&rsquo;s proofs at
      a desk by the window, came forward and welcomed him. Glory held his hand
      with her long hand-clasp and looked steadfastly into his eyes. His face
      twitched and her own blushed deeply, and then she talked in a nervous and
      jerky way, reproaching him for his neglect of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been busy,&rdquo; he began, and then stopped with a sense of hypocrisy.
      &ldquo;I mean worried and tormented,&rdquo; and then stopped again, for Drake had
      dropped his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, though there was nothing to laugh at, and proposed tea,
      rattling along in broken sentences that were spoken with a tremulous
      trill, which had a suggestion of tears behind it. &ldquo;Shall I ring for tea,
      Rosa? Oh, you <i>have</i> rung for tea! Ah, here it comes!&mdash;Thank
      you, Liza. Set it here,&rdquo; seating herself. &ldquo;Now who says the &lsquo;girl&rsquo;?
      Remember?&rdquo; and then more laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was another arrival. It was Lord Robert Ure. He
      kissed Rosa&rsquo;s hand, smiled on Glory, saluted Drake familiarly, and then
      settled himself on a low stool by the tea-table, pulled up the knees of
      his trousers, relaxed the congested muscles of one half of his face, and
      let fall his eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake was handing out the cups as Glory filled them. He was looking at her
      attentively, vexed at the change in her manner since John Storm entered.
      When he returned to his seat on the sofa he began to twitch the ear of her
      pug, which lay coiled up asleep beside him, calling it an ugly little
      pestilence, and wondering why she carried it about with her. Glory
      protested that it was an angel of a dog, whereupon he supposed it was now
      dreaming of paradise&mdash;listen!&mdash;and then there were audible
      snores in the silence, and everybody laughed, and Glory screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, on my honour, my dear,&rdquo; said Drake with a mischievous look at
      John, &ldquo;the creature is uglier than the beast that did the business on the
      day we eloped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloped!&rdquo; cried Rosa and Lord Robert together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, did you never hear that Glory eloped with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory was trying to drown his voice with hollow laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was seven and I was six and a half, and she had proposed to me in the
      orchard the day before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody have more tea? No? Some sally-lunn, perhaps?&rdquo; and then more
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Glory! Nobody wants your tea! Let us hear the story,&rdquo;
       said Rosa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, certainly,&rdquo; said Lord Robert, and everybody laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was all for travel and triumphal processions in those days&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory stopped her ears and began to sing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Willy, Willy Wilkin,
  Kissed the maid a-milkin&rsquo;!
    Fa, la la!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were so many things people could do if they wouldn&rsquo;t waste so much
      time working&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Willy, Willy Wilkin
  Kissed the maid&mdash;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory, if you don&rsquo;t be quiet we&rsquo;ll turn you out!&rdquo; and Rosa got up and
      nourished her proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had brought my dog, and when I called her a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Glory had leaped to her feet and fled from the room. Drake had leaped
      up also, and now, putting his back against the door, he raised his voice
      and went on with his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody saved us, though, and she lay in his arms and kissed him all the
      way home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory was strumming on the door and singing to drown his voice. When the
      story was ended and she was allowed to come back she was panting and
      gasping with laughter, but there were tears in her eyes for all that, and
      Lord Robert was saying, with a sidelong look toward John Storm, &ldquo;Really,
      this ought to be a scene in the new Sigurdsen, don&rsquo;t you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John had retired within himself during this nonsense. He had been feeling
      an intense hatred of the two men, and was looking as gloomy as deep water.
      &ldquo;All acting, sheer acting,&rdquo; he thought, and then he told himself that
      Glory was only worthy of his contempt. What could attract her in the
      society of such men? Only their wealth, and their social station. Their
      intellectual and moral atmosphere must weary and revolt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa had to go to her newspaper office, and Drake saw her to the door.
      John rose at the same time, and Glory said, &ldquo;Going already?&rdquo; but she did
      not try to detain him. She would see him again; she had much to say to
      him. &ldquo;I suppose you were surprised to hear that I had returned to London?&rdquo;
       she said, looking up at his knitted brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer immediately, and Lord Robert, who was leaning against
      the chimney-piece, said in his cold drawl, &ldquo;Your friend ought to be happy
      that you have returned to London, seems to me, my dear, instead of wasting
      your life in that wilderness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John drew himself up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not London I object to,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that was
      inevitable, I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The profession she has come back to follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s amiss with the profession?&rdquo; said Lord Robert, and Drake, who
      returned to the room at the moment, said: &ldquo;Yes, what&rsquo;s amiss with it? Some
      of the best men in the world have belonged to it, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the name of one of them, since the world began, who ever lived an
      active Christian life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert made a kink of laughter, and, turning to the window, began to
      play a tune with his finger tips on the glass of a pane. Drake struggled
      to keep a straight face, and answered, &ldquo;It is not their rôle, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, if that&rsquo;s too much to ask, tell me how many of them have done
      anything in real life, anything for the world, for humanity&mdash;anything
      whatever, I don&rsquo;t care what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unreasonable, sir,&rdquo; said Drake, &ldquo;and such objections could as
      properly apply to the professions of the painter and the musician. These
      are the children of joy. Their first function is to amuse. And surely
      amusement has its place in real life, as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said John, following his own thought, for he had not
      listened, &ldquo;how many of them have lived lives of reckless abandonment,
      self-indulgence, and even scandalous license!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are abuses that apply equally to other professions, sir. Even the
      Church is not free from them. But in the view of reasonable beings one
      clergyman of evil life&mdash;nay, one hundred&mdash;would not make the
      profession of the clergy bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A profession,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;which appeals above all to the senses, and
      lives on the emotions, and fosters jealousy and vanity and backbiting, and
      develops duplicity, and exists on lies, and does nothing to encourage
      self-sacrifice or to help suffering humanity, is a bad profession and a
      sinful one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a profession is sinful,&rdquo; said Drake, &ldquo;in proportion as it appeals to
      the senses, and lives on the emotions, and develops duplicity, then the
      profession of the Church is the most sinful in the world, for it offers
      the greatest temptations to lying, and produces the worst hypocrites and
      impostors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said John, with eyes flashing and passion vibrating in his voice&mdash;&ldquo;that,
      sir, is the great Liar&rsquo;s everlasting lie&mdash;and you know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory was between them with uplifted hands. &ldquo;Peace, peace! Blessed is the
      peacemaker! But tea! Will nobody take more tea? Oh, dear! oh, dear! Why
      can&rsquo;t we have tea over again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean, sir,&rdquo; said Drake. &ldquo;You mean that I have brought
      Glory back to a life of danger and vanity, and sloth and sensuality. Very
      well. I deny your definition. But call it what you will, I have brought
      her back to the only life her talents are fit for, and if that&rsquo;s all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have done the same for your own sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you introduce my sister&rsquo;s name in this connection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how dare you resent it? What&rsquo;s good for one woman is good for
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory was turning aside, and Drake was looking ashamed. &ldquo;Of course&mdash;naturally&mdash;all
      I meant,&rdquo; he faltered&mdash;&ldquo;if a girl has to earn her living, whatever
      her talents, her genius&mdash;that is one thing. But the upper classes, I
      mean the leisured classes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the leisured classes, sir!&rdquo; said John, and in the silence that
      followed the men looked round, but Glory was gone from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert, who had been whistling at the window, said to Drake in a
      cynical undertone: &ldquo;The man is hipped and sore. He has lost his challenge,
      and we ought to make allowances for him, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake tried to laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to make allowances,&rdquo; he said lightly;
      &ldquo;but when a man talks to me as if&mdash;as if I meant to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       but the light tone broke down, and he faced round upon John and burst out
      passionately: &ldquo;What right have you to talk to me like this? What is there
      in my character, in my life, that justifies it? What woman&rsquo;s honour have I
      betrayed? What have I done that is unworthy of the character of an English
      gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John took a stride forward and came face to face and eye to eye with him.
      &ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have used a woman as your decoy to win
      your challenge, as you say, and you have struck me in the face with the
      hand of the woman I love! That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve done, sir, and if it&rsquo;s worthy
      of the character of an English gentleman, then God help England!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake put his hand to his head and his flushed face turned pale. But Lord
      Robert Ure stepped forward and said with a smile: &ldquo;Well, and if you&rsquo;ve
      lost your church so much the better. You are only an outsider in the
      ecclesiastical stud anyway. Who wants you? Your rector doesn&rsquo;t want you;
      your Bishop doesn&rsquo;t want you. Nobody wants you, if you ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you, Lord Robert,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s somebody who does
      want me for all that. Shall I tell you who it is? It&rsquo;s the poor and
      helpless girl who has been deceived by the base and selfish man, and then
      left to fight the battle of life alone, or to die by suicide and go
      shuddering down to hell! That&rsquo;s who wants me, and, God willing, I mean to
      stand by her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damme, sir, if you mean <i>me</i>, let me tell you what <i>you</i> are,&rdquo;
       said Lord Robert, screwing up his eyeglass. &ldquo;You&rdquo;&mdash;shaking his head
      right and left&mdash;&ldquo;you are a man who takes delicately nurtured ladies
      out of sheltered homes and sends them into holes and hovels in search of
      abandoned women and their misbegotten children! Why&rdquo;&mdash;turning to
      Drake-&ldquo;what do you think has happened? My wife has fallen under this
      gentleman&rsquo;s influence&mdash;the poor simpleton!&mdash;and not one hour
      before I left my house she brought home a child which he had given her to
      adopt. Think of it!&mdash;out of the shambles of Soho, and God knows whose
      brat and bastard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were hardly out of the man&rsquo;s mouth when John Storm had taken him
      by both shoulders. &ldquo;God <i>does</i> know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and so do I! Shall I
      tell you whose child that is? Shall I? It&rsquo;s yours!&rdquo; The man saw it coming
      and turned white as a ghost. &ldquo;Yours! and your wife has taken up the burden
      of your sin and shame, for she&rsquo;s a good woman, and you are not fit to live
      on the earth she walks upon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the two men speechless and went heavily down the stairs. Glory was
      waiting for him at the door. Her eyes were glistening after recent tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come no more?&rdquo; she said. She could read him like a book. &ldquo;I can
      see that you intend to come no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not deny it, and after a moment she opened the door and he passed
      out with a look of utter weariness. Then she went back to her room and
      flung herself on the bed, face downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men in the drawing-room were beginning to recover themselves. Lord
      Robert was humming a tune, Drake pacing to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buying up his church to make a theatre for Glory was the very refinement
      of cruelty!&rdquo; said Drake. &ldquo;Good heavens! what possessed me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Original sin, dear boy!&rdquo; said Lord Robert, with a curl of the lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Original? A bad plagiarism, you mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. If <i>I</i> helped you to do it, shall I help you to give it
      up? Withdraw the prospectus and return the deposits on shares&mdash;the
      dear Archdeacon&rsquo;s among the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake took up his hat and left the house. Lord Robert followed him
      presently. Then the drawing-room was empty, and the hollow sound of
      sobbing came down to it from the bedroom above.

      Father Storm read prayers in church that night with a hard and absent
      heart. A terrible impulse of hate had taken hold of him. He hated Drake,
      he hated Glory, he hated himself most of all, and felt as if seven devils
      had taken possession of him, and he was a hypocrite, and might fall dead
      at the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a fate the Almighty has saved me from!&rdquo; he thought. Glory would
      have been a drag on his work for life. He must forget her. She was only
      worthy of his contempt. Yet he could not help but remember how beautiful
      she had looked in her mourning dress, with that pure pale face and its
      signs of suffering! Or how charming she had seemed to him even in the
      midst of all that deception! Or how she had held him as by a spell!
    </p>
    <p>
      Going home he came upon a group of men in the Court. One of them planted
      himself full in front and said with an insolent swagger: &ldquo;Me and my mytes
      thinks there&rsquo;s too many parsons abart &lsquo;ere. What do you think, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there are more gamblers and thieves, my lad,&rdquo; he answered, and at
      the next instant the man had struck him in the face. He closed with the
      ruffian, grappled him by the throat, and flung him on his back. One moment
      he held him there, writhing and gasping, then he said, &ldquo;Get up, and get
      off, and let me see no more of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not this time,&rdquo; said a voice above his back. The crowd had
      melted away and a policeman stood beside them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this
      one for weeks, Father,&rdquo; he said, and he marched the man to jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Charlie Wilkes. At the trial of Mrs. Jupe that morning, Aggie,
      being a witness, had been required to mention his name. It was all in the
      evening papers, and he had been dismissed from his time-keeping at the
      foundry.

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week passed. Breakfast was over at Victoria Square, and John Storm was
      glancing at the pages of a weekly paper. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he cried, and then read
      aloud in a light tone of mock bravery which broke down at length into a
      husky gurgle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The sympathy which has lately been evoked by the announcement that a
      proprietary church in Soho has been sold for secular uses, is creditable
      to public sentiment&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of that, now!&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Callender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;and no doubt the whole community will agree to hope that
      Father Storm will recover from the irritation natural to his eviction&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, we can all get over another body&rsquo;s disappointment, laddie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But there is a danger that in this instance the altruism of the time may
      develop a sentimentality not entirely good for public morals&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the ox is down there are lots of butchers, ye ken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;With the uses to which the fabric is to be converted, it is no part of
      our purpose to deal, further than to warn the public not to lend an ear to
      the all too prurient purity of the amateur moralist; but considering the
      character of the work now carried on in Soho, no doubt with the best
      intentions&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye, it&rsquo;s easy to steal the goose and give the giblets in alms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;it behooves us to consider if the community is not to be
      congratulated on its speedy and effectual ending. Father Storm is a young
      man of some talents and social position, but without any special
      experience or knowledge of the world&mdash;in fact a weak, oversanguine,
      and rather foolish fanatic&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, aye, he&rsquo;s down; down with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;and therefore it is monstrous that he should be allowed to
      subvert the order of social life or disturb the broad grounds of the
      reasonable and the practical&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. High winds only blaw on high hills, laddie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;As for the &ldquo;fallen sister&rdquo; whom he has taken under his
      special care, we confess to a feeling that too much sympathy has been
      wasted on her already. Her feet take hold of hell, her house is the way of
      the grave, going down to the chamber of death&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Callender leaped to her feet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the &lsquo;deacon-man; I ken the
      cloven hoof!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had flung the paper away. &ldquo;What a cowardly world it is!&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;But God wins in the end, and by God he shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, man! don&rsquo;t tak&rsquo; on like that. You can&rsquo;t climb the Alps on
      roller-skates, you see! But as for the Archdeacon, pooh! I&rsquo;m no windy
      aboot your &lsquo;Sisters&rsquo; and &lsquo;Settlements&rsquo; and sic like, but if there had been
      society papers in the Lord&rsquo;s time, Simon the Pharisee would have been a
      namby-pamby critic compared to some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterward she was looking out of the window and holding up both
      hands. &ldquo;My gracious! It&rsquo;s himsel&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s the Prime Minister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gaunt old gentleman with a meagre mustache, wearing a broad-brimmed hat
      and unfashionable black clothes, was stepping up to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s my uncle!&rdquo; said John, and the old lady fled out of the room to
      change her cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard what has happened, John, so I have come to see you,&rdquo; said
      the Prime Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he thinking of the money? John felt uneasy and ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my boy, very sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it all comes, you see, of the ridiculous idea that we are a Christian
      nation! Such a thing couldn&rsquo;t have occurred at the shrine of a pagan god!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only a proprietary church, uncle. I was much to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not deny that you have acted unwisely, but what difference does that
      make, my boy? To sell a church seems like the climax of irreverence; but
      they are doing as bad every day. If you want to see what times the Church
      has fallen on, look at the advertisements in your religious papers&mdash;your
      Benefice and Church Patronage Gazette, and so forth. A traffic, John, a
      slave traffic, worse than anything in Africa, where they sell bodies, not
      souls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a crime which cries to the avenging anger of Heaven,&rdquo; said John;
      &ldquo;but it is the Establishment that is to blame, not the Church, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are a nation of money-lenders, my boy, and the Church is the worst
      usurer of them all, with its learned divines in scarlet hoods, who hold
      shares in music halls, and its Fathers in God living at ease and leasing
      out public-houses. <i>You</i> have been lending money on usury too, and on
      a bad security. What are you going to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with my work, uncle, and do two hours where I did one before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And get yourself kicked where you got yourself kicked before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? If God puts ten pounds on a man, he gives him strength to bear
      twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, John, I am feeling rather sore, and I can&rsquo;t bear much more of it.
      I&rsquo;m growing old, and my life is rather lonely too. Except your father, you
      are my only kinsman now, and it seems as if our old family must die with
      you. But come, my boy, come, throw up all this sorry masquerade. Isn&rsquo;t
      there a woman in the world who can help me to persuade you? I don&rsquo;t care
      who she is, or what, or where she comes from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John had coloured to the eyes, and was stammering something about the true
      priest cut off from earthly marriage, therefore free to commit himself
      completely to his work, when Mrs. Callender came back, spruce and smart,
      with many smiles and curtsies. The Prime Minister greeted her with the
      same old-fashioned courtesy, and they cooed away like two old doves, until
      a splendid equipage drove up to the door, and the plain old gentleman
      drove away in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he nice with me? wasn&rsquo;t he, now?&rdquo; the old lady kept saying, and
      John being silent&mdash;&ldquo;Tut! you young men are just puir loblollyboys
      with a leddy when the auld ones come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going to Soho that day John Storm felt a sudden thrill at seeing on the
      street in front of him, walking in the same direction, an elderly figure
      in cassock and cord. It was the Father Superior of the Brotherhood. John
      overtook him and greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I was on my way to see you, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have heard what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Satan&rsquo;s shafts fly fast.&rdquo; Then taking John&rsquo;s arm as they walked,
      &ldquo;Earthly blows are but reminders of Him, my son, like the hair shirt of
      the monk, and this trouble of yours is God&rsquo;s reminder of your broken
      obedience. What did I tell you when you left us&mdash;that you would come
      back within a year? And you will! Leave the world, my son. It treats you
      badly. The human spirit reigns over it, and even the Church is a Christian
      society out of the sphere and guidance of the Divine Spirit. Leave it and
      return to your unfinished vows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John shook his head and took the Father into the clergy-house, where the
      girls were gathering for the evening. &ldquo;How can I leave the world, Father,
      when there&rsquo;s work like this to do? Society presents to a large proportion
      of these bright creatures the alternative, &lsquo;Sell yourself or starve.&rsquo; But
      God says, &lsquo;Live, work, and love.&rsquo; Therefore society is doomed, and that
      dead man&rsquo;s sepulchre, the Establishment, is doomed, but the Church will
      live, and become the corner-stone of the new order, and stand between
      woman and the world, as it stood of old between the poor and the rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father preached for John that night, taking for his text &ldquo;The flesh
      lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.&rdquo; And on
      parting from him at the door of the sacristy he said: &ldquo;Religious work can
      only be good, my son, if it concerns itself first of all with the
      salvation of souls. Now what if it pleased God to remove you from all this&mdash;to
      call you to a work of intercession&mdash;say, to the mission field?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s face turned pale. &ldquo;There can be no need to fly,&rdquo; he said, with a
      frightened look. &ldquo;Surely London is a mission field wide enough for any
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet who knows? Perhaps for your own soul&rsquo;s sake, lest vanity should take
      hold of you, or the love of fame, or&mdash;or any of the snares of Satan!
      But good-bye, and God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When John Storm reached home he found a letter awaiting him. It was from
      Glory:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you dead and buried? If so, send me word, that I may compose your
      epitaph. &lsquo;Here lies&mdash;<i>Lies</i> is good, for though you didn&rsquo;t
      promise to come back you ought to have done so; therefore it comes to the
      same thing in the end. You must not think too ill of Mr. Drake. I call him
      the milk of human kindness, and his friend Lord Robert the oil thereof&mdash;I
      mean the oil of vitriol. But his temper is like the Caspian Sea, having
      neither ebb nor flow, while yours is like the Bay of Biscay&mdash;oh, so I
      can&rsquo;t expect you to agree. As for poor me, I may be guilty of all the
      seven deadly sins, but I can&rsquo;t see why I should be boycotted on that
      account. There is something I didn&rsquo;t know when you were here, and I want
      to explain about it. Therefore come &lsquo;right away&rsquo; (Lord Bob, Americanized).
      Being slow to anger and plenteous in mercy, I will forgive you if you come
      soon. If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go on the bike&mdash;feminine
      equivalent to the drink. To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;ve done so already,
      having been careering round the gardens of the Inn during the early hours
      of morning, clad in Rosa&rsquo;s &lsquo;bloomers,&rsquo; in which I make a picture and a
      sensation at the same time, she being several sizes larger round the hips,
      and fearfully and wonderfully made. If that doesn&rsquo;t fetch you I&rsquo;ll go in
      for boxing next, and in a pair of four-ounce gloves I&rsquo;ll cut a <i>striking</i>
      figure, I can tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, John Storm, have you cast me off entirely? Do you intend to abandon
      me? Do you think there is no salvation left for me? And are you going to
      let me sink in all this mire without stretching out a hand to help me? Oh,
      dear! oh, dear! I don&rsquo;t know what has come over the silly old world since
      I came back to London. Think it must be teething, judging by the sharpness
      of its bite, and feel as if I should like to give it a dose of syrup of
      squills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As John read the letter his eyelids quivered and his mouth relaxed. Then
      he glanced at it again, and his face clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can not leave her entirely to the mercy of men like these,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      This innocent daring, this babelike ripping up of serviceable conventions&mdash;God
      knows what advantage such men might take of it. He must see her once
      again, to warn, to counsel her. It was his duty&mdash;he must not shrink
      from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a day of painful impressions to Glory. Early in the morning
      Lord Robert had called to take her to the &ldquo;reading&rdquo; of the new play. It
      took place in the saloon of an unoccupied Strand theatre, of which the
      stage also had been engaged for rehearsal. The company were gathered
      there, and, being more or less experienced actors and actresses, they
      received her with looks of courteous indulgence, as one whose leading
      place must be due to other things than talent. This stung her; she felt
      her position to be a false one, and was vexed that she had permitted Lord
      Robert to call for her. But her humiliation had yet hardly begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they stood waiting for the manager, who was late, a gorgeous person
      with a waxed mustache and in a fur-lined coat, redolent of the mixed odour
      of perfume and stale tobacco, forced his way up to her and offered his
      card. She knew the man in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Josephs,&rdquo; he said in a confidential undertone, &ldquo;and if there&rsquo;s
      anything I can do for you&mdash;acting management&mdash;anything&mdash;it
      vill give me pleesure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory flushed up and said, &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t seem to remember, sir, that we
      have met before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled blandly. &ldquo;Oh, yes. I&rsquo;ve kept track of you ever since and
      know all about you. You hadn&rsquo;t made your appearance then, and naturally I
      couldn&rsquo;t do much. But now&mdash;<i>now</i> if you vill give me de pleesure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then an agent is one who can do nothing for you when you want help, but
      when you don&rsquo;t want it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed to carry off his audacity. &ldquo;Veil, you know vhat they say
      of us&mdash;agent from <i>agere</i>, &lsquo;to do,&rsquo; and we&rsquo;re always &lsquo;doing.&rsquo; Ha,
      ha! But if you are villing to let bygones be bygones, I am, and velcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s face was crimson. &ldquo;Will somebody go for the stage doorkeeper?&rdquo; she
      said, and one of the company went out on that errand. Then, raising her
      voice so that everybody listened, she said: &ldquo;Mr. Josephs, when I was quite
      unknown, and trying to get on, and finding it very hard, as we all do, you
      played me the cruellest trick a man ever played on a woman. I don&rsquo;t owe
      you any grudge, but, for the sake of every poor girl who is struggling to
      live in London, I am going to turn you out of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Vhat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stage doorkeeper had entered. &ldquo;Porter, do you see this gentleman? He
      is never to come into this theatre again as long as we are here, and if he
      tries to force his way in you are to call a policeman and have him bundled
      back into the street!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddle doo,&rdquo; and the waxed mustache over the grinning mouth seemed to cut
      the face across.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Josephs had gone Glory could see that the looks of indulgence on the
      faces of the company had gone also. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got the
      stuff in her!&rdquo; said another, but Glory herself was now quaking with fear,
      and her troubles were not yet ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little stout gentleman entered hurriedly with a roll of papers in his
      hand. He stepped up to Lord Robert, apologized for being late, and mopped
      his bald crown and red face. It was Sefton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is to be our manager,&rdquo; said Lord Robert, and Mr. Sefton bobbed his
      head, winked with both eyes, and said, &ldquo;Charmed, I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;charmed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory could have sunk into the earth for shame, but in a moment she had
      realized the crushing truth that when a woman has been insulted in the
      deepest place&mdash;in her honour&mdash;the best she can do is to say
      nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company seated themselves around the saloon, and the reading began.
      First came the list of characters, with the names of the cast. Glory&rsquo;s
      name and character came last, and her nerves throbbed with sudden pain
      when the manager read, &ldquo;and <i>Gloria</i>&mdash;Miss Glory Quayle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a confused murmur, and then the company composed themselves to
      listen. It was Gloria&rsquo;s play. She was rather scandalous. After the first
      act Glory thought it was going to be the story of Nell Gwynne in modern
      life; after the second, of Lady Hamilton; and after the third, in which
      the woman wrecks and ruins the first man in the country, she knew it was
      only another version of the Harlot&rsquo;s Progress, and must end as that had
      ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actors were watching their own parts, and pointing and punctuating
      with significant looks the places where the chances came, but Glory was
      overwhelmed with confusion. How was she to play this evil woman? The
      poison went to the bone, and to get into the skin of such a creature a
      good woman would have to dispossess herself of her very soul. The reading
      ended, every member of the company congratulated some other member on the
      other&rsquo;s opportunities, and Sefton came up to Glory to ask if she did not
      find the play strong and the part magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but only a bad woman could play that part properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll</i> do it, my dear, you&rsquo;ll do it on your own!&rdquo; he answered
      gaily, and she went home perplexed, depressed, beaten down, and ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A newspaper had been left at the door. It was a second-rate theatrical
      journal, still damp from the press. The handwriting on the wrapper was
      that of Josephs, and there was a paragraph marked in blue pencil. It
      pretended to be a record of her short career, and everything was in it&mdash;the
      programme selling, the dressing, the foreign clubs&mdash;all the refuse of
      her former existence, set in a sinister light and leaving the impression
      of an abject up-bringing, as of one who had been <i>in</i> the streets if
      not on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she had chosen her life and must take it at its own price. But, oh,
      the cruelty of the world to a woman, when her very success could be her
      shame! She felt that the past had gripped her again&mdash;the pitiless
      past&mdash;she could never drag herself out of the mire.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night she wrote to John Storm, and next morning before Rosa had risen&mdash;her
      duties kept her up late&mdash;she heard a voice downstairs. Her dog also
      heard it and began to bark. At the next moment John was in the room and
      she was laughing up into his splendid black eyes, for he had caught her
      down at the sofa holding the pug&rsquo;s nose and trying to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you? It&rsquo;s so good of you to come early! But this, dog&rdquo;&mdash;breaking
      into the Manx dialect&mdash;&ldquo;she&rsquo;s ter&rsquo;ble, just ter&rsquo;ble!&rdquo; Then rising and
      looking serious: &ldquo;I wished to tell you that I knew nothing about the
      church, nothing whatever. If I&rsquo;d had the least idea... but they told me
      nothing&mdash;it was very wrong&mdash;nothing. And the first thing I knew
      was when I saw it in all the newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning on the end of the mantelpiece. &ldquo;If they deceived you like
      that, how can you go on with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&rdquo; (she was leaning on the other end, and speaking falteringly),
      &ldquo;you mean that I ought to give it all up. But it&rsquo;s too late for that now.
      It was too late when I came to know. Besides, it would do no good; you
      would be in the same position still, and as for me&mdash;well, somebody
      else would have the theatre, so where&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of the future, Glory, not the past. People who deceive us
      once are capable of doing so again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True&mdash;that&rsquo;s true&mdash;only&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was breaking down, and he turned his eyes away from her, saying,
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all over now, and there&rsquo;s no help for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no help for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to think what he had come to say, but do what he would he could
      not remember. The moment he looked at her the thread of his thoughts was
      lost, and the fragrance of her presence, so sweet, so close, made him feel
      as if he wanted to touch her. There was an awkward silence, and then he
      fidgeted with his hat and moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going so soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must be busy now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then why&mdash;why should we prolong a painful interview, Glory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shot up a look under her eyebrows. His eyes had a harassed expression,
      but there was a gleam in them that set her heart beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so painful? Is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory, I meant to tell you I could not come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! You&rsquo;re not so busy as all that, are you? Surely&rdquo; (the Manx again,
      only she seemed to be breathless now)&mdash;&ldquo;surely you&rsquo;re not so ter&rsquo;ble
      busy but you can just put a sight on a girl now and again for all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture with his hand. &ldquo;It disturbs, it distracts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that all? Then,&rdquo; with a forced laugh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to see you
      instead. Yes, I will, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t do that, Glory. It would only torment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Torment! Gough bless me! Why torment?&rdquo; and a fugitive flame shot up at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&rdquo;&mdash;he stammered, and she could see that his lips quivered;
      then calmly, very calmly, pronouncing the words slowly, and in a voice as
      cold as ice&mdash;&ldquo;because I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know that?&rdquo; His voice was guttural. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you known it all
      along? What&rsquo;s the use of pretending? You&rsquo;ve dragged it out of me. Was that
      only to show your power over me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had heard what her heart wanted to hear, and not for worlds would she
      have missed hearing it, yet she was afraid, and trembling all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We two are of different natures, Glory, that&rsquo;s the trouble between us&mdash;now,
      and always has been. We have nothing in common, absolutely nothing. You
      have chosen your path in life, and it is not my path. I have chosen mine,
      and it is not yours. Your friends are not my friends. We are two different
      beings altogether, and yet&mdash;and yet I love you! And that&rsquo;s why I can
      not come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was sweet, but it was terrible. So different from what she had dreamed
      of: &ldquo;I love you!&mdash;you are my soul!&mdash;I can not live without you!&rdquo;
       Yet he was right. She had slain his love before it was born to her&mdash;it
      was born dead. In an unsteady voice, which had suddenly become husky, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you are right. I must leave you to judge. Perhaps you have
      thought it all out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose it will be easy for me, Glory. I&rsquo;ve suffered a good deal,
      and I dare say I shall suffer more yet. If so, I&rsquo;ll bear it. But for the
      sake of my work&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;But of course I can&rsquo;t expect&mdash;Naturally you love your work
      also&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>do</i> love my work also, and therefore it&rsquo;s no use trifling. &lsquo;If
      thine eye offend&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was stung. &ldquo;Well, since there&rsquo;s no help for it, I suppose we must
      shake hands and part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not until then&mdash;not until he had pronounced his doom and she had
      accepted it did he realize how beautiful she seemed to him. He felt as if
      something in his throat wanted to cry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what I expected, Glory&mdash;what I dreamed of for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s best&mdash;it seems best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to make a place for you, too, but you wouldn&rsquo;t have it&mdash;you
      let it go; you preferred this other lot in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remembered Josephs, and Sefton, and the newspaper, and the part, and
      she covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I go on, Glory, to the peril of my&mdash;It&rsquo;s dangerous, even
      dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are a clergyman and I am an actress. You must think of that.
      People are so ignorant, so cruel, and I dare say they are talking
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I should care for that, Glory?&rdquo; Her hands came down from her
      face. &ldquo;Do you think I should care one jot if all the miserable
      scandal-mongering world thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think the best of me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of both of us as we used to be, my child, before the world
      came between us, before you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was fighting against an impulse to fling herself into his arms, but
      she only said in a soft voice: &ldquo;You are quite right, quite justified. I
      have chosen my lot in life, and must make the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He was holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nevertheless she put her hand behind her, thinking: &ldquo;No; if I shake
      hands with him it will be the end of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; and with an expression of utter despair he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not cry, and when Rosa came down immediately afterward she was
      smiling and her eyes were very bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that your friend Mr. Storm? Yes? You must beware of him, my dear. He
      would stop your career and think he was doing God&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger of that, Rosa. He only came to say he would come no
      more,&rdquo; and then something flashed in her eyes and died away, and then
      flashed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; thought Rosa, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an extraordinary attraction about her that
      makes all other women seem tame.&rdquo; And then Rosa remembered somebody else,
      and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm went back to Soho by way of Clare Market, and when people
      saluted him in the streets with &ldquo;Good-morning, Father,&rdquo; he did not answer
      because he did not see them. On going to church that night he came upon a
      group of Charlie&rsquo;s cronies betting six to one against his getting off, and
      a girl in gay clothes was waiting to speak to him. It was Aggie. She had
      come to plead for Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the drink, sir. &lsquo;E&rsquo;s a good boy when &lsquo;e&rsquo;s not drinking. But I ask
      pardon for &lsquo;im; and if you would only not prosecute&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was ashamed of himself at sight of the girl&rsquo;s fidelity to her
      unworthy lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my child&mdash;what about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right. What&rsquo;s broken can&rsquo;t be mended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile the church bells were ringing and the cabs were running to
      the theatres.

    <h2>
      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rehearsals began early in the morning and usually lasted until late in
      the afternoon. Glory found them wearisome, depressing, and often
      humiliating. The body of the theatre was below the level of the street,
      and in the daytime was little better than a vast vault. If she entered by
      the front she stumbled against seats and saw the figures of men and women
      silhouetted in the distance, and heard the echo of cavernous voices. If by
      the back, she came upon the prompter&rsquo;s table set midway across the stage,
      with a twin gas-bracket shooting up behind it like a geyser, and an open
      space of some twenty feet by twenty in front whereon the imaginary
      passions were to disport themselves at play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory found real ones among them, and they were sometimes in hideous
      earnest. Jealousy, envy, uncharitableness, and all the rancour of life
      where the struggle for it is bitterest, attempts to take advantage of her
      inexperience, to rob her of the best positions on the stage, to cut out
      her lines which &ldquo;scored&rdquo;&mdash;these, with the weary waits, the half
      darkness, the chill atmosphere, the void in front, with its seats in linen
      covers, suggesting an audience of silent ghosts, and then the sense of the
      bright, busy, bustling, rattling, real world above, sent her home day
      after day with a headache, a heartache, and tears bubbling out of her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she had conquered these conditions, or settled down to them, and
      had made such progress with her part as to throw away her scrip, the old
      horror of the woman she was to make herself into, came back as a new
      terror. The visionary Gloria was very proud and vain and selfish, and
      trampled everything under foot that she might possess the world and the
      things of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the real Gloria had a far different part to play. Every morning,
      with a terrible reality at her heart, she glanced over the newspapers for
      news of John Storm. She had not far to look. A sort of grotesque romance
      had gathered about him, as of a modern Don Quixote tilting at windmills.
      His name was the point of a pun; there were cartoons, caricatures, and all
      other forms of the joke that is not a joke because it is an insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she took stolen glances at his work. On Sunday morning she
      walked through Soho, past the people sitting on their doorsteps reading
      the sporting intelligence in the Sunday papers, with their larks in cages
      hung on nails, overhead, until she came to the church, and heard the
      singing inside, and saw chalked up on the walls the legend, &ldquo;God bless the
      Farver!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange charge against a clergyman!&rdquo; It was a low-class paper, and the
      charge was a badge of honour. A young ruffian (it was Charles Wilkes) had
      been brought up on remand on a charge of assaulting Father Storm, and
      being sentenced to a week&rsquo;s imprisonment, notwithstanding the Father&rsquo;s
      appeal and offer of bail, he had accused the clergyman of relations with
      his sweetheart (it was Agatha Jones).
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s anger at the world&rsquo;s treatment of John Storm deepened to a great
      love of the misunderstood and downtrodden man. She saw an announcement of
      his last service, and determined to go to it. The church was crowded,
      chiefly by the poor, and the air was heavy with the smell of oranges and
      beer. It was a week-day evening, and when the choir came in, followed by
      John Storm in his black cassock, Glory could not help a thrill of physical
      joy at being near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text was, &ldquo;Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are
      like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outside, but
      are within full of dead men&rsquo;s bones and all uncleanness!&rdquo; The first half
      of the, sermon was a denunciation of the morality of men. We made clean
      the outside of the platter, but the so-called purity of England was a smug
      sham built upon rottenness and sin! There were men among us, damned
      sensualists, left untouched by the idleness of the public conscience, who
      did not even know where their children were to be found. Let them go down
      into the gutters of life and look for their own faces, and&mdash;God
      forgive them!&mdash;their mothers&rsquo; faces, among the outcast and the
      criminal. The second half was a defence of woman. The sins of the world
      against women were the most crying wrongs of the time. Had they ever
      reflected on the heroism of women, on their self-denying, unrewarded
      labour? Oh, why was woman held so cheap as in this immoral London of
      to-day? There had been scarcely a breach of the law of Nature by women,
      and not one that men were not chiefly to blame for. Men tempted them by
      love of dress, of ease, of money, and of fame, to forget their proper
      vocation; but every true woman came right in the end, and preferred to the
      false and fictitious labour for worldly glory, a mother&rsquo;s silent and
      unseen devotion, counting it no virtue at all. &ldquo;Yes, women, mothers,
      girls, in your hands lies the salvation of England. May you live in this
      prospect, and may God and his ever-blessed Mother be your reward all
      through this weary life and in glory everlasting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a procession with banners, cross, stars, green and blue
      fleur-de-lis, but Glory saw none of it. She was kneeling with her head
      down and heart choked with emotion. The next she knew the service was
      over, the congregation was gone; only one old woman in widow&rsquo;s weeds was
      left, jingling a bunch of keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the Father gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am; he is still in the sacristy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment, with fluttering throat and a look of mingled love and
      awe, she was standing eye to eye with John Storm in the little bare
      chamber off the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory, why do you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we said good-bye and parted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did. I didn&rsquo;t. It was not so easy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy? I told you it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy, my child, and it hasn&rsquo;t been. I
      said I should suffer, and I have suffered. But I&rsquo;ve borne it&mdash;you see
      I&rsquo;ve borne it. Don&rsquo;t ask me at what cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; and she covered her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the devil tortured me with love first. I was seeing you and hearing
      you everywhere and in everything, Glory. But I got over that, and then he
      tortured me with remorse. I had left you to the mercy of the world. It was
      my duty to watch over you. I did it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you never knew that, but no matter! It&rsquo;s all over now, and I&rsquo;m a
      different man entirely. But why do you come and torment me again? It&rsquo;s
      nothing to you, nothing at all. You can shake it off in a moment. That&rsquo;s
      your nature, Glory; you can&rsquo;t help it. But have you no pity? You find me
      here, trying to help the helpless&mdash;the brave girls who have the
      virtue to be poor, and the strength to be weak, and the courage to be
      friendless. Why can&rsquo;t you leave me alone? What am I to you? Nothing at
      all! You care nothing for me&mdash;nothing whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up again, and the look of love in her eyes was stronger now
      than the look of awe. He saw it and could not help knowing how strongly it
      worked upon his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to your own world, unhappy girl! You love it&mdash;you must; you
      have sacrificed the best impulses of your heart to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was smiling now. It was the old radiant smile, but with a gleam of
      triumph in it that he had never seen before. It worked like madness upon
      him, and he tried to insult her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to your own company, to the people who <i>play</i> at real life,
      and build toy houses, and give themselves away body and soul for the
      clapping of hands in a theatre! Go back to the lies and hypocrisies of
      society, and the brainless, mashers who adorn it! They dance superbly, and
      are at home in drawing-rooms, and know all about sporting matters and
      theatrical affairs! I know none of these things, and I am kicked and
      cuffed and ridiculed and hounded down as an indecent man or shunned as a
      moral leper I Why do you come to me?&rdquo; he cried, hoarse and husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she only stretched out her hands to him and said, &ldquo;Because I love
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; He was quivering with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, and have always loved you, and you love me&mdash;you know you
      do&mdash;you love me still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake! Glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a wild shout of joy he rushed upon her, flung his arms about her, and
      covered her face and hands with kisses. After a moment he whispered, &ldquo;Not
      here, not here!&rdquo; and she felt too that the room was suffocating them, and
      they must go out into the open air, the fields, the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody was knocking at the door. It was Mrs. Pincher. A man was waiting
      to speak to the Father. They found him in the lane. It was Jupe, the
      waiter. His simple face wore a strange expression of joy and fear, as if
      he wished to smile and dare not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pore missis &lsquo;as got off and wants to come &lsquo;ome, sir, and I thought as
      you&rsquo;d tell me what I oughter do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her back and forgive her, my man, that&rsquo;s the Christian course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His love was now boundless; his large charity embraced everything, and
      going off he saluted everybody. &ldquo;Good-evening, Mrs. Pincher.&mdash;Good-night,
      Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;e <i>is</i> a Father, too, and no mistake!&rdquo; somebody was saying
      behind him as he went away with Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was at the full, and while they were passing through the streets
      it struggled with the gas from the shop windows as the flame of a fire
      struggles with the sunshine, but when they passed under the trees it shone
      out in its white splendour like a bride. The immeasurable vault above was
      silvered with stars, too, through depth on depth of space, and all the
      glorious earth and heaven seemed to smile the smile of love. A strong
      south breeze was blowing, and as it shook the trees of the park, that
      blessed patch of Nature in the midst-of the toiling city seemed to sing
      the song of love!
    </p>
    <p>
      Their hands found each other and they walked along almost in silence,
      afraid to break the spell of their dream lest they should awake and find
      it gone. It seemed wonderful to him that they were together, and he could
      hardly believe it was reality, though the touch of her hand filled him
      with a strange physical exultation which he had never felt before. He
      seemed to be walking on the clouds, and she too was swaying by his side as
      if her blood was dancing. Sometimes she dried her glistening eyes, and
      once she stopped and swung in front of him and looked long at him and then
      raised her face to his and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether you like it or not your life is bound up with mine for ever and
      ever!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had to be,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I know it now. I can no longer deceive
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we shall be happy? In spite of all you said we shall be very happy,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that will be quite forgotten, Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And forgiven,&rdquo; she said, and then between a sigh and a blush she asked
      him to kiss her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind swept the hood of her cape about her head and he could smell the
      fragrance of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to think what he had done to deserve such happiness, but all the
      suffering he had gone through seemed as nothing compared to a joy like
      this. The great clock of Westminster swung its hollow sounds into the air,
      which went riding by on the wind like the notes of an organ, now full and
      now as soft as a baby&rsquo;s whisper. They could hear the far-off rumble of the
      vast city which fringed their blessed island like a mighty sea, and
      through the pulse of their clasped hands it seemed as if they felt the
      pulse of the world. An angel had come down and breathed on the face of the
      waters, and it was God&rsquo;s world, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her home, and they parted at the door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in to-night,&rdquo;
       she whispered. She wished to be alone, that she might think it all out and
      go over it again, every word, every look. There was a lingering hand-clasp
      and then she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned through the park and tried to step over the very places where
      her feet had trod. On reaching Buckingham Gate he turned back and walked
      round the park, and again round it, and yet again. The bells tolled out
      the hours, the cabs went westward with ladies in evening wraps going home
      from theatres, the tide of traffic ebbed farther and farther and died
      down, but still he walked and the wind sang to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God can not blame us,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;We were made to love each other.&rdquo; He
      uncovered his head to let the wind comb through his hair, and he was
      happy, happy, happy! Sometimes he shut his eyes, and then it was hard to
      believe that she was not walking by his side, a fragrant presence in the
      moonlight, going step by step with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the day was near the wind had gone, the little world of wood was
      silent, and his footsteps crunched on the gravel. Then a yellow gleam came
      in the sky to the east, and a chill gust swept up as a scout before the
      dawn, the trees began to shiver, the surface of the lake to creep, the
      birds to call, and the world to stretch itself and yawn.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Peace in her chamber, wheresoe&rsquo;er
  It be&mdash;a holy place.
</pre>
    <p>
      As he went home by Birdcage Walk the park was still heavy with sleep, and
      its homeless wanderers had not yet risen from their couches on the seats.
      A pale mist was lying over London, but the towers of the Abbey stood clear
      above it, and pigeons were wheeling around them like sea-fowl about rocks
      in the sea. What a night it had been! A night of dreams, of love, of
      rapture!
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets were empty and very quiet&mdash;only the slow rattle of the
      dust-cart and the measured step of policemen changing beats. Long blue
      vistas and a cemetery silence as of a world under the great hand of the
      gentle brother of Death, and then the clang of Big Ben striking six.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter was waiting for John in the breathless hall. It was from the
      Bishop of London: &ldquo;Come and see me at St. James&rsquo;s Square.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly there sprang out to Glory the charm and fascination of the life
      she was putting away. Trying to be true to her altered relations with John
      Storm, she did not go to rehearsal the next morning&mdash;, but not yet
      having the courage of her new position, she did not tell Rosa her true
      reason for staying away. The part was exhausting&mdash;it tried her very
      much; a little break would do no harm. Rosa wrote to apologize for her on
      the score of health, and thus the first cloud of dissimulation rose up
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days passed, and then a letter came from the manager: &ldquo;Trust you are
      rested and will soon be back. The prompter read your lines, but everything
      has gone to pieces. Slack, slovenly, spiritless, stupid, nobody acting,
      and nobody awake, it seems to me. &lsquo;All right at night, governor,&rsquo; and the
      usual nonsense. Shows how much we want you. But envious people are
      whispering that you are afraid of the part. The blockheads! If you succeed
      this time you&rsquo;ll be made for life, my dear. And you <i>will</i> succeed!
      Yours merrily,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this were three letters addressed to the theatre. One of them was
      from a press-cutting agency asking to be allowed to supply all newspaper
      articles relating to herself, and inclosing a paragraph as a specimen: &ldquo;A
      little bird whispers that &lsquo;Gloria,&rsquo; as &lsquo;Gloria,&rsquo; is to be a startling
      surprise. Those who have seen her rehearse&mdash;&mdash;But mum&rsquo;s the word&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      we could an&rsquo; we would,&rdquo; etc. Another of the letters was from the art
      editor of an illustrated weekly asking for a sitting to their photographer
      for a full-page picture; and the third inclosed the card of an interviewer
      on an evening paper. Only three days ago Glory would have counted all this
      as nothing, yet now she could not help but feel a thrilling, joyous
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake called after the absence of a fortnight. He had come to speak of his
      last visit. His face was pale and serious, not fresh and radiant as usual,
      his voice was shaking and his manner nervous. Glory had never seen him
      exhibit so much emotion, and Rosa looked on in dumb astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was to blame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I have come to say so. It was a cowardly
      thing to turn the man out of his church, and it was worse than cowardly to
      use you in doing it. Everything is fair, they say, in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But
      he flushed up like a girl and stopped, and then faltered: &ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;m
      sorry&mdash;very sorry; and if there is anything I can do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory tried to answer him, but her heart was beating violently, and she
      could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;ve tried to make amends already. Lord Robert has a living
      vacant in Westminster, and I&rsquo;ve asked him to hand it over to the Bishop,
      with the request that Father Storm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told him he must. It&rsquo;s the least we can do if we are to have any
      respect for ourselves. And anyhow, I&rsquo;m about tired of this anti-Storm
      uproar. It may be all very well far men like me to object to the man&mdash;I
      deny his authorities, and think him a man out of his century and country&mdash;but
      for these people with initials, who write in the religious papers, to rail
      at him, these shepherds who live on five thousand a year and pretend to
      follow One who hadn&rsquo;t a home or a second coat, and whose friends were
      harlots and sinners, though he was no sinner himself&mdash;it&rsquo;s infamous,
      it&rsquo;s atrocious, it raises my gorge against their dead creeds and paralytic
      churches. Whatever his faults, he is built on a large plan, he has the
      Christ idea, and he is a man and a gentleman, and I&rsquo;m ashamed that I took
      advantage of him. That&rsquo;s all over now, and there&rsquo;s no help for it; but if
      I might hope that you will forgive&mdash;and forget&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Glory in a low voice, and then there was silence, and when she
      lifted her head Drake was gone and Rosa was wiping her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all for love of you, Glory. A woman can&rsquo;t hate a man when he does
      wrong for love of herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm came in later the same day, when Rosa had gone out and Glory
      was alone. He was a different man entirely. His face looked round and his
      dark eyes sparkled. The clouds of his soul seemed to have drifted away,
      and he was boiling over with enthusiasm. He laughed constantly, and there
      was something almost depressing in the lumbering attempts at humour of the
      serious man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think has happened? The Bishop sent for me and offered me a
      living in Westminster. It turns out to being the gift of Lord Robert Ure;
      but no thanks to him for it. Lady Robert was at the bottom of everything.
      She had called on the Bishop. He remembered me at the Brotherhood, and
      told me all about it. St. Jude&rsquo;s, Brown&rsquo;s Square, on the edge of the worst
      quarter in Christendom! It seems the Archdeacon expected it for Golightly,
      his son-in-law. The Reverend Joshua called on me this morning and tried to
      bully me, but I soon bundled him off to Botany Bay. Said the living had
      been promised to him&mdash;a lie, of course. I soon found that out. A lie
      is well named, you know&mdash;it hasn&rsquo;t a leg&mdash;to stand upon. Ha, ha,
      ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing would serve but that they should go to look at the scene of their
      future life, and with Don&mdash;he had brought his dog; it had to be held
      back from the pug under the table&mdash;they set off immediately. It was
      Saturday night, and as they dipped down into the slums that lie under the
      shadow of the Abbey, Old Pye Street, Peter&rsquo;s Street, and Duck Lane were
      aflare with the coarse lights of open naphtha lamps, and all but
      impassable with costers&rsquo; barrows. There were the husky voices of the
      street hawkers, the hoarse laughter, the quarrelling, the oaths, the
      rasping shouts of the butcher selling chunks of dark joints by auction,
      the screeches of the roast-potato man, and the smell of stale vegetables
      and fried fish. &ldquo;Jow, &lsquo;ow much a pound for yer turmaters?&rdquo; &ldquo;Three pence; I
      gave mor&rsquo;n that for &lsquo;em myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Garn!&rdquo; &ldquo;S&rsquo;elp me, Gawd, I did, mum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a glorious scene?&rdquo; said John; and Glory, who felt chilled and
      sickened, recalled herself from some dream of different things altogether
      and said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanctuary, too! What human cats we are! The poor sinners cling to the
      place still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her into the alleys and courts that score and wrinkle the map of
      Westminster like an old man&rsquo;s face, and showed her the &ldquo;model&rdquo;
       lodging-houses and the gaudily decorated hells where young girls and
      soldiers danced and drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of saying to these people, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t drink; don&rsquo;t steal&rsquo;?
      They&rsquo;ll answer, &lsquo;If you lived in these slums you would drink too.&rsquo; But
      we&rsquo;ll show them that we can live here and do neither&mdash;that will be
      the true preaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he pictured a life of absolute self-sacrifice, which she was to
      share with him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll manage all money matters, Glory. You can&rsquo;t think
      how I&rsquo;m swindled. And then I&rsquo;m such a donkey as far as money goes&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      not far with me, you know. Ha, ha, ha! Who&rsquo;s to find it? Ah, God pays his
      own debts. He&rsquo;ll see to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were to live under the church itself; to give bread to the hungry and
      clothes to the naked; to set up their Settlement in the gaming-house of
      the Sharkeys, now deserted and shut up; to take in the <i>un</i>deserving
      poor-the people who had nothing to say for themselves, precisely those;
      and thus they were to show that they belonged neither to the publicans and
      sinners nor to the Scribes and Pharisees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only let us get rid of self. Only let us show that self-interest never
      enters our head in one single thing we do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and meantime
      Glory, who had turned her head aside with a lump in her throat, heard some
      one behind them saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd, Jow, that&rsquo;s the curick and his dorg&mdash;&lsquo;im as got pore Sharkey
      took! See&mdash;&lsquo;im with the laidy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S&rsquo;elp me, so it is! Another good man gorn to &lsquo;is gruel, and all &lsquo;long of
      a bloomin&rsquo; dorg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked round by the church. John was talking&mdash;rapturously at
      every step, and Glory was dragging after him like a criminal going to the
      pillory. At last they came out by Great Smith Street, and he cried: &ldquo;See,
      there&rsquo;s the house of God under its spider&rsquo;s web of scaffolding, and here&rsquo;s
      the Broad Sanctuary&mdash;broad enough in all conscience! Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of girls and men were trooping out of a place of entertainment
      opposite, and there were screams and curses. &ldquo;Look at &lsquo;im!&rdquo; cried a
      woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;There &lsquo;e is, the swine! And &lsquo;e was the ruin of me; and now
      &lsquo;e&rsquo;s &lsquo;listed for a soldier and going off with another woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bleedin&rsquo; drunk, that&rsquo;s what you are!&rdquo; said a man&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;and if
      you down&rsquo;t take kear I&rsquo;ll send ye &lsquo;ome on a dawer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike me, will ye, ye dog? Do it! I dare you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t worth it, soldier&mdash;come along,&rdquo; said another female voice,
      whereupon the first broke into a hurricane of oaths; and a little
      clergyman going by at the moment&mdash;it was the Rev. J. Golightly&mdash;said:
      &ldquo;Dear, dear! Are there no policemen about?&rdquo; and so passed on, with his
      tall wife tucked under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm pressed through the crowd and came between the two who were
      quarrelling. By the light of the lamp he could see them. The man was
      Charlie Wilkes, in the uniform of a soldier; the woman, with the paint
      running on her face, her fringe disordered, and her back hair torn down,
      was Aggie Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We down&rsquo;t want no religion &lsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Charlie, sneering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get some, though, if you&rsquo;re not off quick!&rdquo; said John. The man
      looked round for the dog and a moment afterward he had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory came up behind. &ldquo;O Aggie, woman, is it you?&rdquo; she said, and then the
      girl began to cry in a drunken sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls is cruel put upon, mum,&rdquo; said one of the women; and another cried,
      &ldquo;Nix, the slops!&rdquo; and a policeman came pushing his way and saying: &ldquo;Now,
      then, move on! We ain&rsquo;t going to stand &lsquo;ere all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call a cab, officer,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes sir&mdash;certainly, Father. Four-wheel-er!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you live, Aggie?&rdquo; said Glory; but the girl, now sobbing drunk,
      was too far gone to follow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lives in Brown&rsquo;s Square, sir,&rdquo; said the woman who had spoken before,
      and when the cab came up she was asked to get in with the other three.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tenement house, fronting to one facade of St. Jude&rsquo;s, and Aggie&rsquo;s
      room was on the second story. She was helpless, and John carried her up
      the stairs. The place was in hideous disorder, with clothing lying about
      on chairs, underclothing scattered on the floor, the fire out, many
      cigarette ends in the fender, a candle stuck in a beer bottle, and a bunch
      of withered roses on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      As John laid the girl on the bed she muttered, &ldquo;Lemme alone!&rdquo; and when he
      asked what was to happen to her when she grew old if she behaved like this
      when young, she mumbled: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to be old. Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to like me
      then, d&rsquo;ye think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterward Glory and John were passing through the gates into
      Clement&rsquo;s Inn, with its moonlight and silence, its odour of moistened
      grass, its glimpse of the stars, and the red and white blinds of its
      windows lit up round about. John was still talking rapturously. He was now
      picturing the part which Glory was to play in the life they were to live
      together. She was to help and protect their younger sisters, the
      child-women, the girls in peril, to enlist their loyalty and filial
      tenderness for the hour of temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be glorious? To live the life, the real life of warfare with the
      world&rsquo;s wickedness and woe! Won&rsquo;t it be magnificent? You&rsquo;ll do it too!
      You&rsquo;ll go down into those slums and sloughs which I&rsquo;ve shown you to-night&mdash;they
      are the cradle of shame and sin, Glory, and this wicked London rocks it!&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      go down into them like a ministering angel to raise the fallen and heal
      the wounded! You&rsquo;ll live in them, revel in them, rejoice in them, they&rsquo;ll
      be your battlefield. Isn&rsquo;t that better, far better, a thousand times
      better, than <i>playing</i> at life, and all its fashions and follies and
      frivolities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory struggled to acquiesce, and from time to time in a trembling voice
      she said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; until they came to the door of the Garden
      House, and then a strange thing happened. Somebody was singing in the
      drawing-room to the music of the piano. It was Drake. The window was open
      and his voice floated over the moonlit gardens;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Du liebes Kind, komm&rsquo; geh mit mir!
  Gar schöne Spiele spiel&rsquo; ich mit dir.

    <p>
      Suddenly it seemed to Glory that two women sprang into life in her&mdash;one
      who loved John Storm and wished to live and work beside him, the other who
      loved the world and felt that she could never give it up. And these two
      women were fighting for her heart, which should have it and hold it and
      possess it forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at John, and he was smiling triumphantly, &ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy! I know a hundred men who are a hundred times as rich as I, but not
      one who is a hundredth part as happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; she whispered, holding back her tears. Then looking away from
      him she said, &ldquo;And do you really think I&rsquo;m good enough for a life of such
      devotion and self-sacrifice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; he cried, and for a moment his merry laughter drowned the
      singing overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will the world think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly. But who cares what the world thinks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do, dear&mdash;we must!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, while the song went on, she began to depreciate herself in a low
      voice and with a creeping sense of hypocrisy&mdash;to talk of her former
      life in London as a danger, of the tobacco-shop, the foreign clubs, the
      music hall, and all the mire and slime with which she had been besmirched.
      &ldquo;Everything is known now, dear. Have you never thought of this? It is your
      duty to think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he only laughed again with a joyous voice. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the odds?&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;The world is made up for the most part of low, selfish, sensual beings,
      incapable of belief in noble aims. Every innovator in such a world exposes
      himself to the risk of being slandered or ridiculed, or even shut up in a
      lunatic asylum. But who wouldn&rsquo;t rather be St. Theresa in her cell than
      Catharine of Russia on her throne? And in your case, what does it come to
      anyway? Only that you&rsquo;ve gone through the fiery furnace and come out
      unscathed. All the better&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be a living witness, a proof that
      it is possible to pass through this wicked Babylon unharmed and
      untouched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if I were a man&mdash;but with a woman it is so different! It is an
      honour to a man to have conquered the world, but a disgrace to a woman to
      have fought with it. Yes, believe me, I know what I&rsquo;m saying. That&rsquo;s the
      cruel tragedy in a woman&rsquo;s life, do what you will to hide it. And then you
      are so much in the eye of the world; and besides your own position there
      is your family&rsquo;s, your uncle&rsquo;s. Think what it would be if the world
      pointed the finger of scorn at your&mdash;at your mission&mdash;at your
      high and noble aims&mdash;and all on account of me! You would cease to
      love me-and I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; He had been shuffling restlessly on the pavement before her.
      &ldquo;Here I stand! Here are you! Let the waves of public opinion dash
      themselves against us&mdash;we stand or fall together!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was crying on his breast, but with what mixed and conflicting
      feelings! Joy, pain, delight, dread, hope, disappointment. She had tried
      to dishonour herself in his eyes, and it would have broken her heart if
      she had succeeded. But she had failed and he had triumphed, and that was
      harder still to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      From overhead they heard the last lines of the song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Erreicht den Hof mit Müh und Noth
  In seinen Armen das Kind war todt.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she whispered, and fled into the house. The lights in the
      dining-room were lowered, but she found a telegram that was waiting on the
      mantelpiece. It was from Sefton, the manager: &ldquo;Author arrived in London
      today. Hopes to be at rehearsal Monday. Please be there certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The world was seizing her again, the imaginary Gloria was dragging her
      back with visions of splendour and success. But she crept upstairs and
      went by the drawing-room on tip-toe. &ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;My face
      is not fit to be seen to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a dying fire in her bedroom, and her evening gown had been laid
      out on a chair in front of it. She put the gown away in a drawer, and out
      of a box which she drew from beneath the bed she took a far different
      costume. It was the nurse&rsquo;s outdoor cloak, which she had bought for use at
      the hospital. She held it a moment by the tips of her fingers and looked
      at it, and then put it back with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gloria! is that you?&rdquo; Rosa called up the stairs; and Drake&rsquo;s cheery voice
      cried, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t our nightingale come down and give us a stave before I go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late! Just going to bed. Good-night,&rdquo; she answered. Then she lit a
      candle and sat down to write a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, dear John, I can not! It would be like putting bad money
      into the offertory to put me into that holy work. Not that I don&rsquo;t admire
      it, and love it, and worship it. It is the greatest work in the world, and
      last week I thought I could count everything else as dross, only
      remembering that I loved you and that nothing else mattered. But now I
      know that this was a vain and fleeting sentiment, and that the sights and
      scenes of your work repel me on a nearer view, just as the hospital
      repelled me in the early mornings when the wards were being cleaned and
      the wounds dressed, and before the flowers were laid about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, forgive me, forgive me! But if I am fit to join your life at all it
      can not be in London. That &lsquo;old serpent called the devil and Satan&rsquo; would
      be certain to torment me here. I could not live within sight and sound of
      London and go on with the life you live. London would drag me back. I feel
      as if it were an earlier lover, and I must fly away from it. Is that
      possible? Can we go elsewhere? It is a monstrous demand, I know. Say you
      can not agree to it. Say so at once&mdash;it will serve me right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stout watchman of the New Inn was calling midnight when Glory stole
      out to post her letter. It fell into the letter-box with a thud, and she
      crept back like a guilty thing.

    <p>
      Next morning Mrs. Callender heard John Storm singing to himself before he
      left his bedroom, and she was standing at the bottom of the stairs when he
      came down three steps at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, laddie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to see your face shining a body would say
      that somebody had left ye a legacy or bought ye a benefice instead of
      taking your church frae ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, and better than both, and that&rsquo;s just what I was going to tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be in a hurry to do it, too, coming downstairs like a cataract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came down like a cataract yourself once on a time, auntie; I&rsquo;ll lay
      my life on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, did I, and not sae lang since neither. And fools and prudes cried
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; and called me a tomboy. But, hoots; I was nought but a body born a
      wee before her time. All the lasses are tomboys now, bless them, the
      bright heart-some things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; said John softly, seating himself at the breakfast table, &ldquo;what
      d&rsquo;ye think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She eyed him knowingly. &ldquo;Nay, I&rsquo;m ower thrang working to be bothered
      thinking. Out with it, laddie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked wise. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember saying&mdash;that work like mine
      wanted a woman&rsquo;s hand in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her old eyes blinked. &ldquo;Maybe I did, but what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve taken your advice, and now a woman&rsquo;s hand is coming into it to
      guide it and direct it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be the right hand, though, mind that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>will</i> be the right hand, auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, that&rsquo;s grand,&rdquo; with another twinkle. &ldquo;I thought it might be the <i>left</i>,
      ye see, and ye might be putting a wedding-ring on it!&rdquo; And then she burst
      into a peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However did you find it out?&rdquo; he said, with looks of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, laddie, love and a cough can not be hidden. And to think a woman
      couldna see through you, too! But come,&rdquo; tapping the table with both
      hands, &ldquo;who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one of your Sisters&mdash;no?&rdquo; with hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some other simpering thing, na doot-they&rsquo;re all alike these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you say the girls were all tomboys now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I did, d&rsquo;ye want a body to be singing the same song always? But
      come, what like is she? When I hear of a lassie I like fine to know her
      colour first. What&rsquo;s her complexion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she fair? But what a daft auld dunce I am!&mdash;to be sure she&rsquo;s
      fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how did you know that, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! They say a dark man is a jewel in a fair woman&rsquo;s eye, and I&rsquo;ll
      warrant it&rsquo;s as true the other way about. But what&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s face suddenly straightened and he pretended not to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo; stamping with both feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, auntie, what an ugly old cap you&rsquo;re wearing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugly?&rdquo; reaching up to the glass. &ldquo;Who says it&rsquo;s ugly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! you&rsquo;re only a bit boy, born yesterday. But, man, what&rsquo;s all this
      botherment about telling a lassie&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring her to see you, auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you will, indeed! and michty quick, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was on Sunday, and by the first post on Monday John Storm received
      Glory&rsquo;s letter. It fell on him like a blast out of a cloud in the black
      northeast, and cut him to the heart&rsquo;s core. He read it again, and being
      alone he burst into laughter. He took it up a third time, and when he had
      finished there was something at his throat that seemed to choke him. His
      first impulse was fury. He wanted to rush off to Glory and insult her, to
      ask her if she was mad or believed him to be so. Because she was a coward
      herself, being slave-bound to the world and afraid to fight it face to
      face, did she wish to make a coward of him also&mdash;to see him sneak
      away from the London that had kicked him, like a cur with its tail between
      its legs?
    </p>
    <p>
      After this there came an icy chill and an awful consciousness that
      mightier forces were at work than any mere human weakness. It was the
      world itself, the great pitiless world, that was dividing them again as it
      had divided them before, but irrevocably now-not as a playful nurse that
      puts petted children apart, but as a torrent that tears the cliffs
      asunder. &ldquo;Leave the world, my son, and return to your unfinished vows.&rdquo;
       Could it be true that this was only another reminder of his broken
      obedience?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came pity. If Glory was slave-bound to the world, which of us was not
      in chains to something? And the worst slavery of all was slavery to self.
      But that was an abyss he dared not look into; and he began to think
      tenderly of Glory, to tell himself how much she had to sacrifice, to
      remember his anger and to be ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed, and he went about his work in a helpless way, like a
      derelict without rudder or sail and with the sea roaring about it. Every
      afternoon when he came home from Soho Mrs. Callender would trip into the
      hall wearing a new cap with a smart bow, and finding that he was alone she
      would say, &ldquo;Not to-day, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; he would answer, and they would try to smile. But seeing the
      stamp of suffering on his face, she said at last, &ldquo;Tut, laddie! they love
      too much who die for love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the Sunday afternoon following he turned again toward Clement&rsquo;s Inn. He
      had come to a decision at last, and was calm and even content, yet his
      happiness was like a gourd which had grown up in a day, and the morrow&rsquo;s
      sun had withered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory had been to rehearsal every day that week. Going to the theatre on
      Monday night she had said to herself, &ldquo;There can be no harm in rehearsing&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      not compelled to play.&rdquo; Notwithstanding her nervousness, the author had
      complimented her on her passion and self-abandonment, and going home she
      had thought: &ldquo;I might even go through the first performance and then give
      it all up. If I had a success, that would be beautiful, splendid, almost
      heroic&mdash;it would be thrilling to abandon everything.&rdquo; Not hearing
      from John, she told herself he must be angry, and she felt sorry for him.
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know yet how much I am going to do.&rdquo; Thus the other woman in
      her tempted and overcame her, and drew her on from day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Macrae sent Lord Robert to invite her to luncheon on Sunday. &ldquo;There
      can be no harm in going there,&rdquo; she thought. She went with Rosa, and was
      charmed with the lively, gay, and brilliant company. Clever and beautiful
      women, clever and handsome men, and nearly all of them of her own
      profession. The mistress of the mansion kept open house after church
      parade on Sunday, and she sat at the bottom of her table, dressed in black
      velvet, with the Archdeacon on her right and a famous actor on her left.
      Lord Robert sat at the head and talked to a lady whose remarks were heard
      all over the room; but Lady Robert was nowhere to be seen; there was a
      hush when her name was mentioned, and then a whispered rumour that she had
      differences with her husband, and had scandalized her mother by some act
      of indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s face beamed, and for the first half-hour she seemed to be on the
      point of breaking into a rapturous &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Nearly opposite to her at the
      table sat a lady whose sleepy look and drowsy voice and airs of languor
      showed that she was admired, and that she knew it. Glory found her very
      amusing, and broke into little trills of laughter at her weary, withering
      comments. This drew the attention of some of the men; they found the
      contrast interesting. The conversation consisted first of hints, half
      signs, brilliant bits of by-play, and Glory rose to it like a fish to the
      May-fly. Then it fell upon bicycling and the costumes ladies wore for it.
      The languid one commented upon the female fetich, the skirt, and condemned
      &ldquo;bloomers,&rdquo; whereupon Glory declared that they were just charming, and
      being challenged (by a gentleman) for her reasons she said, &ldquo;Because when
      a girl&rsquo;s got them on she feels as if she&rsquo;s an understudy for a man, and
      may even have a chance of playing the part itself in another and a better
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was general laughter, and the gentleman said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the
      profession yourself now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a stranger within your gates,&rdquo; she answered; and when the talk
      turned on a recent lawsuit, and the languid one said it was inconceivable
      that the woman concerned could have been such a coward in relation to the
      man, Glory protested that it was just as natural for a woman to be in fear
      of a man (if she loved him) as to be afraid of a mouse or to look under
      the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma chère</i>,&rdquo; said a dainty little lady sitting next but one (she had
      come to London to perform in a silent play), &ldquo;they tells me you&rsquo;s half my
      countrywoman. All right. Will you not speak de French to poor me?&rdquo; And
      when Glory did so the little one clapped her hands and declared she had
      never heard the English speak French before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say French-cum-Irish,&rdquo; said Glory, &ldquo;or, rather, French which begat Irish,
      which begat Manx!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Original, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said somebody who was laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a sea-gull among so many pigeons!&rdquo; said somebody else, and the
      hothouse airs of the languid lady were lost as in a fresh gust from the
      salt sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her spirits subsided the moment she had recrossed the threshold. As
      they were going home in the cab, past the hospital and down Piccadilly.
      Rosa, who was proud and happy, said: &ldquo;There! All society isn&rsquo;t stupid and
      insipid, you see; and there are members of your own profession who try to
      live up to the ideal of moral character attainable by a gentleman in
      England even yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, no doubt... But, Rosa, there&rsquo;s another kind of man altogether, whose
      love has the reverence of a religion, and if I ever meet a man like that&mdash;one
      who is ready to trample all the world under his feet for me&mdash;I think&mdash;yes,
      I really think I shall leave everything behind and follow him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave everything behind, indeed! That <i>would</i> be pretty! When
      everything yields before you, too, and all the world and his wife are
      waiting to shout your praises!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosa had gone to her office, and Glory was turning over some designs for
      stage costumes, when Liza came in to say that the &ldquo;Farver&rdquo; was coming
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has come to scold me,&rdquo; thought Glory, so she began to hum, to push
      things about, and fill the room with noise. But when she saw his drawn
      face and wide-open eyes she wanted to fall on his neck and cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come to tell me you can&rsquo;t do what I suggested?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of
      course you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly, very slowly. &ldquo;I have thought it all over, and
      concluded that I can&mdash;that I must. Yes, I am willing to go away,
      Glory, and when you are ready I shall be ready too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&mdash;where&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet; but I am willing to wait for the unrolling of the
      scroll. I am willing to follow step by step, not knowing whither. I am
      willing to go where God wills, for life or death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your work in London&mdash;your great, great work&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God will see to that, Glory. He can do without any of us. None of us can
      do without him. The sun will set without any assistance, you know,&rdquo; and
      the pale face made an effort to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, John, my dear, dear John, this is not what you expected, what you
      have been thinking of and dreaming of, and building your hopes upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and for your sake I am sorry, very sorry. I thought of a
      great career for you, Glory. Not rescue work merely&mdash;others can do
      that. There are many good women in the world&mdash;nearly all women are
      good, but Jew are great&mdash;and for the salvation of England, what
      England wants now is a great woman.... As for me&mdash;God knows best! He
      has his own way of weaning us from vanity and the snares of the devil. You
      were only an instrument in his hands, my child, hardly knowing what you
      were doing. Perhaps he has a work of intercession for us somewhere&mdash;far
      away from here&mdash;in some foreign mission field&mdash;who can say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A feeling akin to terror caught her breath, and she looked up at him with
      tearful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, I am glad that this has happened,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will help me
      to conquer self, to put self behind my back forever, to show the world, by
      leaving London, that self has not entered into my count at all, and that I
      am thinking of nothing but my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A warm flush rose to her cheeks as he spoke, and again she wanted to fling
      herself on his neck and cry. But he was too calm for that, too sad and too
      spiritual. When he rose to go she held out her hands to him, but he only
      took them and carried them to his lips, and kissed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was alone she flung herself down and cried, &ldquo;Oh, give me
      strength to follow this man, who mistakes his love of me for the love of
      God!&rdquo; But even while she sat with bent head and her hands over her face
      the creeping sense came back as of another woman within her who was
      fighting for her heart. She had conquered again, but at what a cost! The
      foreign mission field&mdash;what associations had she with that? Only the
      memory of her father&rsquo;s lonely life and friendless death.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was feeling cold and had begun to shiver, when the door opened and
      Rosa entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he <i>did</i> come again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he would,&rdquo; and Rosa laughed coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That when religious feelings take possession of a man he will stop at
      nothing to gain the end he has in view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosa,&rdquo; said Glory, flushing crimson, &ldquo;if you imply that my friend is
      capable of one unworthy act or thought I must ask you to withdraw your
      words absolutely and at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, dear. I was only thinking for your own good. We working women
      must not ruin our lives or let anybody else ruin them. &lsquo;Duty,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;self-sacrifice&rsquo;&mdash;I know the old formulas, but I don&rsquo;t believe in
      them. Obey your own heart, my dear, that is your first duty. A man like
      Storm would take you out of your real self, and stop your career, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my career, my career! I&rsquo;m tired to death of hearing of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who knows? I may not go on with it, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have lost your sense of duty to yourself, have you forgotten your
      duty to Mr. Drake? Think what Mr. Drake has done for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Drake! Mr. Drake! I&rsquo;m sick of that too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange you are to-night, Glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I? So are you. It is Mr. Drake here and Mr. Drake there! Are you
      trying to force me into his arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you that says that, Glory&mdash;you? and to me, too? Don&rsquo;t you see
      that this is a different case altogether? And if I thought of my own
      feelings only&mdash;consulted my own heart&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Is it so very foolish? Yes, he is young and handsome, and rich and
      brilliant, while I&mdash;I am ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Rosa; I don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, though; and when you came in between us&mdash;young and beautiful
      and clever&mdash;everything that I was not, and could never hope to be&mdash;and
      he was so drawn to you&mdash;what was I to do? Nurse my hopeless and
      ridiculous love&mdash;or think of him&mdash;his happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosa, my poor dear Rosa, forgive me! forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, dinner being over, they had returned to the drawing-room.
      Rosa was writing at the table, and there was no sound in the room except
      the scratching of her pen, the falling of the slips of &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; and the
      dull reverberation of the bell of St. Clement&rsquo;s Danes, which was ringing
      for evening service. Glory was sitting at the desk by the window, with her
      head on her hands, looking down into the garden. Out of the dead load at
      her heart she kept saying to herself: &ldquo;Could I do that? Could I give up
      the one I loved for his own good, putting myself back, and thinking of him
      only?&rdquo; And then a subtle hypocrisy stole over her and she thought, &ldquo;Yes I
      could, I could!&rdquo; and in a fever of nervous excitement she began to write a
      letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind bloweth where it listeth, and so with a woman&rsquo;s will. I can not
      go abroad with you, dear, because I can not allow myself to break up your
      life, for it <i>would</i> be that&mdash;it would, it would, you know it
      would! There are ten thousand men good enough for the foreign mission
      field, but there is only one man in the world for your work in London.
      This is one of the things hidden from the wise, and revealed to children
      and fools. It would be wrong of me to take you away from your great scene.
      I daren&rsquo;t do it. It would be too great a responsibility. My conscience
      must have been dead and buried when I suggested such a possibility! Thank
      God, it has had a resurrection, and it is not yet too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the letter was sealed and stamped, and sent out to the post, she
      thought: &ldquo;I must be mad, and there is no method in my madness either. What
      do I want&mdash;to join his life in London?&rdquo; And then remembering what she
      had written, it seemed as if the other woman must have written it&mdash;the
      visionary woman, the woman she was making herself into day by day.

    <h2>
      XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Storm had left home early on Monday morning. It was the last day of
      his tenancy of the clergy-house, and there was much to do at Soho. Toward
      noon he made his way to the church in Bishopsgate Street for the first
      time since he had left the Brotherhood. It was midday service, and the
      little place was full of business men with their quick, eyes and eager
      faces. The Superior preached, and the sermon was on the religious life. We
      were each composed of two beings, one temporal, the other eternal, one
      carnal, the other spiritual. Life was a constant warfare between these two
      nearly matched forces, and often the victory seemed to sway from this side
      to that. Our enemy with the chariots of iron was ourselves. There was a
      Judas in each one of us ready to betray us with a kiss if allowed. The
      lusts of the flesh were the most deadly sins, absolute chastity the most
      pleasing to God of all virtues. Did we desire to realize what the
      religious life could be? Then let us reflect upon the news which had come
      from the South Seas. What was the word that had fallen that morning on all
      Christendom like a thunderclap, say, rather, like the blast of a celestial
      trumpet? Father Damien was dead! Think of his lonely life in that distant
      island where doomed men lived out their days. Cut off from earthly
      marriage, with no one claiming his affection in the same way as Christ, he
      was free to commit himself entirely to God and to God&rsquo;s afflicted
      children. He was truly married to Christ. Christ occupied his soul as Lord
      and spouse. Glorious life! Glorious death! Eternal crown of glory waiting
      for him in the glory everlasting!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the service ended John Storm stepped up to speak to the Father. His
      wide-open eyes were flaming; he was visibly excited. &ldquo;I came to ask a
      question,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it is answered already. I will follow Father
      Damien and take up his work. I was thinking of the mission field, but my
      doubt was whether God had called me, and I had great fear of going
      uncalled. God brought me here this morning, not knowing what I was to do,
      but now I know, and my mind is made up at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Father was not less moved. They went out into the courtyard together
      and walked to and fro, planning, scheming, contriving, deciding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take the vows first, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The life vows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but will that be necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be best. Think what a peculiar appeal it have for those poor
      doomed creatures! They are cut off from the world by a terrible
      affliction, but you will be cut off by the graciousness of a Christ-fed
      purity. They are lepers made of disease; you will be as a leper for the
      kingdom of heaven&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Father&mdash;if that be so&mdash;how much greater the appeal will be
      if&mdash;if a woman goes out also! Say she is young and beautiful and of
      great gifts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Andrew may go with you, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Brother Andrew as well. But holy men in all ages have been bound by
      ties of intimacy and affection to good women who have lived and worked
      beside them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sisters, my son, elder sisters always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not? Sister, indeed, and united to me by a great and spiritual
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are none of us invincible, my son; let us not despise danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danger, Father! What is the worth of my religion if it does not enable me
      to defy that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well&mdash;do not decide too soon. I&rsquo;ll come to you at Soho this
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do. It&rsquo;s our last night there. I must tell my poor people what my plans
      are to be. Good-bye for the present, Father, good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my son,&rdquo; and as John Storm went off with a light heart and
      bounding step the Father passed indoors with downcast face, saying to
      himself with a sigh, &ldquo;Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
      fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day again, the streets were thronged, and John Storm
      was long in forging his way home. Glory&rsquo;s letter was waiting for him, and
      he tore it open with nervous fingers, but when he had read it he laughed
      aloud. &ldquo;God bless her! But she doesn&rsquo;t know everything yet.&rdquo; Mrs.
      Callender was out in the carriage; she would be back for lunch, and the
      maid was laying the cloth; but he would not wait. After scribbling a few
      lines in pencil to tell of his great resolve, he set off to Clement&rsquo;s Inn.
      The Strand was less crowded when he returned to it, and the newsboys were
      calling the evening papers with &ldquo;Full Memoir of Father Damien.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      On coming home from rehearsal Glory had found the costume for her third
      act, her great act, awaiting her. All day long she had been thinking of
      her letter to John, half ashamed of it, half regretting it, almost wishing
      it could be withdrawn. But the dress made a great tug at her heart, and
      she could not resist the impulse to try it on. The moment she had done so
      the visionary woman whose part she was to play seemed to take possession
      of her, and shame and regret were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a magnificent stage costume, green as the grass in spring with the
      morning sun on it. The gown was a splendid brocade with gold-embroidered
      lace around the square-cut neck and about the shoulders of the tight-made
      sleeves. Round her hips was a sash of golden tissue, and its hanging ends
      were fringed with emeralds. A band of azure stones encircled her head, and
      her fingers were covered with turquoise rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the drawing-room, shut the door, and began to rehearse the
      scene. It was where the imaginary Gloria, being vain and selfish, trampled
      everything under her feet that she might possess the world and the things
      of the world. Glory spoke the words aloud, forgetting they were not her
      own, until she heard another voice saying, &ldquo;May I come in, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was John at the door. She was ashamed of her costume then, but there
      was no running away. &ldquo;Yes, of course, come in,&rdquo; she cried, trembling all
      over, half afraid to be seen, and yet proud too of her beauty and her
      splendour. When he entered she was laughing nervously and was about to
      say, &ldquo;See, this has happened before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he saw nothing unusual, and she was disappointed and annoyed. Coming
      in breathless, as if he had been running, he flung himself down on one end
      of the couch, threw his hat on the other end, and said: &ldquo;What did I tell
      you, Glory? That a way would open itself, and it has!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think of it when you saw the news in the papers this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Father Damien is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can you&mdash;do you really mean that&mdash;do you intend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, Glory&mdash;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t get my letter this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, dear, yes; but you were only thinking for me&mdash;God bless
      you!&mdash;that I was giving up a great scene for a little one. But this&mdash;this
      is the greatest scene in the world, Glory. Life is a small sacrifice; the
      true sacrifice is a living death, a living crucifixion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt as if he had taken her by the throat and was choking her. He had
      got up and was walking to and fro, talking impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a great sacrifice I am asking you to make now, dear. That
      far-off island, the poor lepers, and then lifelong banishment. But God
      will reward you, and with interest too. Only think, Glory! Think of the
      effect of your mere presence out there among those poor doomed creatures!
      A young and beautiful woman! Not a melancholy old dolt like me, preaching
      and prating to them, but a bright and brilliant girl, laughing with them,
      playing games with them, making mimicry for them, and singing to them in
      the voice of an angel. Oh, they&rsquo;ll love you, Glory, they&rsquo;ll worship you&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      be next to God and his blessed mother with them. And already I hear them
      saying among themselves: &lsquo;Heaven bless her! She might have had the world
      at her feet and made a great name and a great fortune, but she gave it all
      up&mdash;all, all, all&mdash;for pity and love of us!&rsquo; Won&rsquo;t it be
      glorious, my child? Won&rsquo;t it be the noblest thing in all the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she struggled to answer, &ldquo;Yes, no doubt&mdash;the noblest thing in all
      the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you agree? Ah, I knew your heart spoke in your first letter, and you
      wanted to leave London. You shall, too, for God has willed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she recovered a little and made a nervous attempt to withdraw. &ldquo;But
      the church at Westminster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed like a boy. &ldquo;Oh, Golightly may have that now, and welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the work in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s all right, Glory. Ever since I heard from you I have been
      dealing with the bonds which bound me to London one by one, unravelling
      some and breaking others. They are all discharged now, every one of them,
      and I need think of them no more. Self is put behind forever, and I can
      stand before God and say: &lsquo;Do with me as you will; I am ready for anything&mdash;anything!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crying, Glory? My poor, dear child! But why are you crying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure&mdash;quite sure? Am I asking too much of you? Don&rsquo;t let us
      deceive ourselves&mdash;think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us talk of something else now.&rdquo; She began to laugh. &ldquo;Look at me, John&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      I look well to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always look well, Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t there any difference&mdash;this dress, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his sight came back and his big eyes sparkled. &ldquo;How beautiful you
      are, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Do I look nice then&mdash;really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My beautiful, beautiful girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head was thrown back, and she glowed with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come too near me, you know&mdash;don&rsquo;t crush me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, no fear of that&mdash;I should be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I mustn&rsquo;t be touched exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will they think, I wonder, those poor, lost creatures, so ugly, so
      disfigured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my red hair. This colour suits it, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some Madonna, they&rsquo;ll say; the very picture of the mother of God
      herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you afraid of me in this frock, dear? Shall I run and
      take it off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no; let me look at you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t like me to-day, for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know you&rsquo;ve never once kissed me since you came into the room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love! my love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he said, close to her lips, &ldquo;are you ready for anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment she was holding herself off with her arms stiff about
      his neck, that she might look at him and at her lace sleeves at the same
      time. Suddenly a furrow crossed his brow. He had remembered the Father&rsquo;s
      warning, and was summoning all his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But out there I&rsquo;ll love you as a sister, Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of those poor doomed beings cut off from earthly love we&rsquo;ll
      love each other as the angels love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is the highest, purest, truest love, no doubt. Still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the old Talmud say?&mdash;&lsquo;He who divorces himself from the
      joys of earth weds himself to the glories of Paradise.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lashes were still wet; she was gazing deep into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think of being united in the next world, Glory&mdash;what
      happiness, what ecstasy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love me in this world, dearest,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be their youth, Glory, their strength, their loveliness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be mine, darling, be mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the furrow crossed his brow a second time, and he disengaged himself
      before their lips had met again. Then he walked about the room as before,
      talking in broken sentences. They would have to leave soon&mdash;very soon&mdash;almost
      at once. And now he must go back to Soho. There was so much to do, to
      arrange. On reaching the door he hesitated, quivering with love, hardly
      knowing how to part from her. She was standing with head down, half angry
      and half ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>au revoir</i>,&rdquo; he cried in a strained voice, and then fled down
      the stairs. &ldquo;The Father was right,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;No man is invincible.
      But, thank God, it is over! It can never occur again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her glow had left her, and she felt chilled and lost There was no help for
      it now, and escape was impossible. She must renounce everything for the
      man who had renounced everything for her. Sitting on the couch, she
      dropped her head on the cushion and cried like a child. In the lowest
      depths of her soul she knew full well that she could never go away, but
      she began to bid good-bye in her heart to the life she had been living.
      The charm and fascination of London began to pass before her like a
      panorama, with all the scenes of misery and squalor left out. What a
      beautiful world she was leaving behind her! She would remember it all her
      life long with useless and unending regret. Her tears were flowing through
      the fingers which were clasped beneath her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A postman&rsquo;s knock came to the door downstairs. The letter was from the
      manager, written in the swirl and rush of theatrical life, and reading
      like a telegram: &ldquo;Theatre going on rapidly, men working day and night,
      rehearsals advanced and scenery progressing; might we not fix this day
      fortnight for the first performance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inclosed with this was a letter from the author: &ldquo;You are on the eve of an
      extraordinary success, dear Gloria, and I write to reassure and
      congratulate you. Some signs of inexperience I may perhaps observe, some
      lack of ease and simplicity, but already it is a performance of so much
      passion and power that I predict for it a triumphant success. A great
      future awaits you. Don&rsquo;t shrink from it, don&rsquo;t be afraid of it; it is as
      certain as that the sun will rise to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She carried the letter to her lips, then rose from the couch, and threw up
      her head, closed her eyes, and smiled. The visionary woman was taking hold
      of her again with the slow grip and embrace of the glacier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa came home to dine, and at sight of the new costume she cried, &ldquo;Shade
      of Titian, what a picture!&rdquo; During dinner she mentioned that she had met
      Mr. Drake, who had said that the Prince was likely to be present at the
      production, having asked for the date and other particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you heard the <i>great</i> news, dear? It&rsquo;s in all the late
      editions of the evening papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Glory; but she saw what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Storm is to follow Father Damien. That&rsquo;s the report, at all
      events; but he is expected to make a statement at his club to-night, and I
      have to be there for the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as dinner was over Rosa went off to Soho, and then Glory was
      brought back with a shock to the agony of her inward struggle. She knew
      that her hour had arrived, and that on her action now everything depended.
      She knew that she could never break the chains by which the world and her
      profession held her. She knew that the other woman had come, that she must
      go with her, and go for good. But the renunciation of love was terrible.
      The day had been soft and beautiful. It was falling asleep and yawning
      now, with a drowsy breeze that shook the yellow leaves as they hung
      withered and closed on the thinning boughs like the fingers of an old
      maid&rsquo;s hand. She was sitting at the desk by the window, trying to write a
      letter. More than once she tore up the sheet, dried her eyes, and began
      again. What she wrote last was this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible, dear John. I can not go with you to the South Seas. I
      have struggled, but I can not, I can not! It is the greatest, noblest,
      sublimest mission in the world, but I am not the woman for these high
      tasks. I should be only a fruitless fig tree, a sham, a hypocrite. It
      would be like taking a dead body with you to take me, for my heart would
      not be there. You would find that out, dear, and I should be ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I can not leave this life&mdash;I can not give up London. I am
      like a child&mdash;I like the bustling streets, the brilliant
      thoroughfares, the crowds, the bands of music, the lights at night, and
      the sense of life. I like to succeed, too, and to be admired, and&mdash;yes,
      to hear the clapping of hands in a theatre. You are above all this, and
      can look down at it as dross, and I like you for that also. But give it
      all up I can&rsquo;t; I haven&rsquo;t the strength; it is in my blood, dear, and if I
      part from it I must die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I like to be fondled and coaxed and kissed, and I want so much&mdash;oh,
      so much to be loved! I want somebody to tell me every day and always how
      much he loves me, and to praise me and pet me and forget everything else
      for me, everything, everything, even his own soul and salvation! You can
      not do that; it would be sinful, and besides it wouldn&rsquo;t be love as you
      understand it, and as it ought to be, if you are to go out to that solemn
      and awful task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I said I loved you I spoke the truth, dear, and yet I didn&rsquo;t know
      what the word meant really, I didn&rsquo;t realize everything. I love you still&mdash;with
      all my heart and soul I love you; but now I know that there is a
      difference between us, that we can never come together. No, I can not
      reach up to your austere heights. I am so weak; you are so strong. Your
      &lsquo;strength is as the strength of ten because your heart is pure,&rsquo; while I&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am unworthy of your thoughts, John. Leave me to the life I have chosen.
      It may be poor and vain and worthless, but it is the only life I&rsquo;m fit
      for. And yet I love you&mdash;and you loved me. I suppose God makes men
      and women like that sometimes, and it is no use struggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One kiss, dear&mdash;it is the last.&rdquo;

    <p>
      John Storm went back to Victoria Square with a bright and joyful face and
      found Mrs. Callender waiting for him, grim as a judge. He could see that
      her eyes were large and red with weeping, but she fell on him instantly
      with withering scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re here at last, are ye? A pretty senseless thing this is, to be
      sure! What are you dreaming about? Are you bewitched or what? Do you
      suppose things can be broken off in this way? You to go to the leper
      islands indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m called, auntie, and when God calls a man, what can he do but answer
      with Samuel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! Don&rsquo;t talk sic nonsense. Besides, Samuel had some sense. He waited
      to be called three times, and I havena heard this is your third time of
      calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm laughed, and that provoked her to towering indignation. &ldquo;Good
      God, what are you thinking of, man? There&rsquo;s that puir lassie&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      running away from her, too, aren&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s shameful, it&rsquo;s disgraceful,
      it&rsquo;s unprincipled, and <i>you</i> to do it too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble about that, auntie,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;she is going with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Callender, and her face expressed boundless
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;you women are brimful of courage, God bless you! and
      she&rsquo;s the bravest of you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll no have the assurance to tak&rsquo; that puir bit lassie to yonder
      God-forsaken spot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants to go&mdash;at least she wants to leave London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she? Weel, weel! But didn&rsquo;t I say she was nought but one of
      your Sisters or sic-like?&mdash;And you&rsquo;re going to let a slip of a girl
      tak&rsquo; you away frae your ain work and your ain duty&mdash;and you call
      yourself a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to coax and appease her, and before long the grim old face was
      struggling between smiles and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! get along wi&rsquo; ye! I&rsquo;ve a great mind, though&mdash;I&rsquo;d be liking fine
      to see her anyway. Now, where does she bide in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want to know that, auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it to you, laddie? Can&rsquo;t a body call to say &lsquo;Good-bye&rsquo; to a
      lassie, and tak&rsquo; her a wee present before going away, without asking a
      man&rsquo;s permission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t do it, though, if I were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s as bright as a star and as quick as a diamond, and she&rsquo;d
      see through you in a twinkling. Besides, I shouldn&rsquo;t advise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your advice like your salt till you&rsquo;re asked for it, my man&mdash;and
      to think of any reasonable body giving up his work in London for that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good men have gone out to the mission field, auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mission fiddlesticks! Just a barber&rsquo;s chair, fit for every comer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then this isn&rsquo;t the mission field exactly either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mair&rsquo;s the pity, and then you wouldna be running bull-neck on your death
      before your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of us can do that, auntie, for heaven is over all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High words off an empty stomach, my man, so you can just keep them to
      cool your parridge. But oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear! You&rsquo;ll forget your puir
      auld Jane Callender, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, auntie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last I&rsquo;m to see of you, laddie. I&rsquo;m knowing that fine&mdash;and
      me that fond of you too, and looking on you as my ain son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, auntie, come; you mustn&rsquo;t take it so seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think a bit thing like that can make all this botherment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, it&rsquo;s my own doing&mdash;absolutely mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye, man&rsquo;s the head, but woman turns it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dined together and then got into the carriage for Soho. John talked
      continually, with an impetuous rush of enthusiasm; but the old lady sat in
      gloomy silence, broken only by a sigh. At the corner of Downing Street he
      got out to call on the Prime Minister, and sent the carriage on to the
      clergy-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A newsboy going down Whitehall was calling an evening paper. John bought a
      copy, and the first thing his eye fell upon was the mention of his own
      name: &ldquo;The announcement in another column that Father Storm of Soho
      intends to take up the work which the heroic Father Damien has just laid
      down will be received by the public with mingled joy and regret&mdash;joy
      at the splendid heroism which prompts so noble a resolve, regret at the
      loss which the Church in London will sustain by the removal of a clergyman
      of so much courage, devotion, independence, and self-sacrifice.... That
      the son of a peer and heir to an earldom should voluntarily take up a life
      of poverty in Soho, one of the most crowded, criminal, and neglected
      corners of Christendom, was a fact of so much significance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm crushed the paper in his hand and threw it into the street; but
      a few minutes afterward he saw another copy of it in the hands of the
      Prime Minister as he came to the door of the Cabinet room to greet him.
      The old man&rsquo;s face looked soft, and his voice had a faint tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are bringing me bad news, John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John laughed noisily. &ldquo;Do I look like it, uncle? Bad news, indeed! No, but
      the best news in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am about to be married. You&rsquo;ve often told me I ought to be, and now I&rsquo;m
      going to act on your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bleak old face was smiling. &ldquo;Then the rumour I see in the papers isn&rsquo;t
      true, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s true enough, and my wife is to go with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you considered that carefully? Isn&rsquo;t it a terrible demand to
      make of any woman? Women are more religious than men, but they are more
      material also. Under the heat of religious impulse a woman is capable of
      sacrifices&mdash;great sacrifices&mdash;but when it has cooled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear of that, uncle,&rdquo; said John; and then he told the Prime Minister
      what he had told Mrs. Callender&mdash;that it was Glory&rsquo;s proposal that
      they should leave London, and that without this suggestion he might not
      have thought of his present enterprise. The bleak face kept smiling, but
      the Prime Minister was asking himself: &ldquo;What does this mean? Has she <i>her
      own</i> reasons for wishing to go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my boy, that with all this talk you&rsquo;ve not yet told me who
      she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John told him, and then a faint and far-off rumour out of another world
      seemed to flit across his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An actress at present, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So to speak, but ready to give up everything for this glorious mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very brave, no doubt, very beautiful; but what of your present
      responsibilities&mdash;your responsibilities in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I came to speak about,&rdquo; said John; and then his
      rapturous face straightened, and he made some effort to plunge into the
      practical aspect of his affairs at Soho. There was his club for girls and
      his home for children. They were to be turned out of the clergy-house
      tomorrow, and he had taken a shelter at Westminster. But the means to
      support them were still deficient, and if there was anything coming to him
      that would suffice for that purpose&mdash;if there was enough left&mdash;if
      his mother&rsquo;s money was not all gone&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister was looking into John&rsquo;s face, watching the play of his
      features, but hardly listening to what he said. &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he
      was asking himself, in the old habitual way of the man whose business it
      is to read the motives that are not revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are willing to leave London, after all, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, uncle? London is nothing to me in itself, less than nothing; and
      if that brave girl to whom it is everything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet six months ago I gave you the opportunity of doing so, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my head was full of dreams, sir. Thank God, they are gone now, and I
      am awake at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Church&mdash;I thought your duty and devotion to the Church&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Church is a chaos, uncle, a wreck of fragments without unity,
      principle, or life. No man can find foothold in it now without
      accommodating his duty and his loyalty to his chances of a livelihood. It
      is a career, not a crusade. Once I imagined that a man might live as a
      protest against all this, but it was a dream, a vain and presumptuous
      dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then your woman movement&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another dream, uncle! A whole standing army marshalled and equipped to do
      battle against the world&rsquo;s sins toward woman could never hope for victory.
      Why? Because the enemy is ourselves, and only God can contend against a
      foe like that. He will, too! For the wrongs inflicted on woman by this
      wicked and immoral London God will visit it with his vengeance yet. I see
      it coming, it is not far off, and God help those&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely, my boy, surely it is not necessary to fly away from the world
      in order to escape from your dreams? Just when it is going to be good to
      you, too. It was kicking and cuffing and laughing at you only yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-morrow it would kick and cuff and laugh at me again. Oh, it is a
      cowardly and contemptible world, uncle, and happy is the man who wants
      nothing of it! He is its master, its absolute master, and everybody else
      is its wretched slave. Think of the people who are scrambling for fame and
      titles and decorations and invitations to court! They&rsquo;ll all be in their
      six feet by two feet some-day. And then think of the rich men who hire
      detectives to watch over their children lest they should be stolen for
      sake of a ransom, while they themselves, like human mill-horses, go
      tramping round and round the safes which contain their securities! Oh,
      miserable delusion, to think that because a nation is rich it is therefore
      great! Once I thought the Church was a refuge from this worst of the
      spiritual dangers of the age, and so it would have been if it had been
      built on the Gospel. But it isn&rsquo;t; it loves the thrones of the world and
      bows down to the golden calf. Poverty! Give me poverty and let me renounce
      everything. Jesus, our blessed Jesus, he knew well what he was doing in
      choosing to be poor, and even as a man he was the greatest being that ever
      trod upon the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this leper island mission is not poverty merely, my dear John&mdash;it
      is death, certain death, sooner or later, and God knows what news the next
      mail may bring us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that I feel I am in God&rsquo;s hands, sir, and he knows best what is
      good for us. People talk about dying before their time, but no man ever
      did or ever will or ever can do so, and it is blasphemy to think of it.
      Then which of us can prolong our lives by one day or hour or minute? But
      God can do everything. And what a grand inspiration to trust yourself
      absolutely to him, to raise the arms heavenward which the world would
      pinion to your side and cry, &lsquo;Do with me as thou wilt, I am ready for
      anything&mdash;anything.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremor passed over the wrinkles about the old man&rsquo;s eyes, and he
      thought: &ldquo;All this is self-deception. He doesn&rsquo;t believe a word of it.
      Poor boy! his heart alone is leading him, and he is the worst slave of us
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he said aloud: &ldquo;Things haven&rsquo;t fallen out as I expected, John, and I
      am sorry, very sorry. The laws of life and the laws of love don&rsquo;t always
      run together&mdash;I know that quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John flinched, but made no protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall feel as if I were losing your mother a second time when you leave
      me, my boy. To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;ve been watching you and thinking of
      you, though you haven&rsquo;t known it. And you&rsquo;ve rather neglected the old man.
      I thought you might bring your wife to me some day, and that I might live
      to see your children. But that&rsquo;s all over now, and there seems to be no
      help for it. They say the most noble and beautiful things in the world are
      done in a state of fever, and perhaps this fever of yours&mdash;-H&rsquo;m. As
      for the money, it is ready for you at any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be much left, uncle. I have gone through most of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, John, no; the money you spent was my money&mdash;your own is still
      untouched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too good, uncle, and if I had once thought you wished to see more
      of me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I know, I know. It was a wise man who said it was hard to love a
      woman and do anything else, even to love God himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John dropped his head and turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But come again before you leave London&mdash;if you do leave it&mdash;and
      now good-bye, and God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news of John Storm&rsquo;s intention to follow Father Damien had touched and
      thrilled the heart of London, and the streets and courts about St. Mary
      Magdalene&rsquo;s were thronged with people. In their eyes he was about to
      fulfil a glorious mission, and ought to be encouraged and sustained.
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Father!&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; cried another. A young
      woman with timid eyes stretched out her hand to him, and then everybody
      attempted to do the same. He tried to answer cheerfully, but was conscious
      that his throat was thick and his voice was husky. Mrs. Pincher was at the
      door of the clergy-house, crying openly and wiping her eyes. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there
      lepers enough in London, sir, without goin&rsquo; to the ends of the earth for
      &lsquo;em?&rdquo; He laughed and made an effort to answer her humorously, but for some
      reason both words and ideas failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The club-room was crowded, and among the girls and the Sisters there were
      several strange faces. Mrs. Callender sat at one end of the little
      platform, and she was glowering across at the other end, where the Father
      Superior stood in his black cassock, quiet and watchful, and with the
      sprawling, smiling face of Brother Andrew by his side. The girls were
      singing when John entered, and their voices swelled out as they saw him
      pushing his way through. When the hymn ended there was silence for a
      moment as if it was expected that he would speak, but he did not rise, and
      the lady at the harmonium began again. Some of the young mothers from the
      shelter above had brought down their little ones, and the thin, tuneless
      voices could be heard among the rest:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  There&rsquo;s a Friend for little children
    Above the bright blue sky.
</pre>
    <p>
      John had made a brave fight for it, but he was beginning to break down.
      Everybody else had risen, he could not rise. An expression of fear and at
      the same time of shame had come into his face. Vaguely, half-consciously,
      half-reproachfully, he began to review the situation. After all, he was
      deserting his post, he was running away. This was his true scene, his true
      work, and if he turned his back upon it he would be pursued by eternal
      regrets. And yet he must go, he must leave everything&mdash;that alone he
      understood and felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, God knows why, he began to think of something which had
      happened when he was a boy. With his father he was crossing the Duddon
      Sands. The tide was out, far out, but it had turned, it was galloping
      toward them, and they could hear the champing waves on the beach behind.
      &ldquo;Run, boy, run! Give me your hand and run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he resumed the current of his former thoughts. &ldquo;What was I thinking
      about?&rdquo; he asked himself; and when he remembered, he thought, &ldquo;I will give
      my hand to the heavenly Father and go on without fear.&rdquo; At the second
      verse he rallied, rose to his feet, and joined in the singing. It was said
      afterward that his deep voice rang out above all the other voices, and
      that he sang in rapid and irregular time, going faster and faster at every
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the last verse but one, when he saw a young girl crushing
      her way toward him with a letter. She was smiling, and seemed proud to
      render him this service. He was about to lay the letter aside when he
      glanced at it, and then he could not put it down. It was marked &ldquo;Urgent,&rdquo;
       and the address was in Glory&rsquo;s handwriting. The champing waves were in his
      ears again. They were coming on and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A presentiment of evil crept over him and he opened the letter and read
      it. Then his life fell to wreck in a moment. Its nullity, its
      hopelessness, its futility, its folly, the world with its elusive joys,
      love with its deceptions so cruel and so sweet-all, all came sweeping up
      on him like the sea-wrack out of a storm. In an instant the truth appeared
      to him, and he understood himself at last. For Glory&rsquo;s sake he had
      sacrificed everything and deceived himself before God and man. And yet she
      had failed him and forsaken him, and slipped out of his hands in the end.
      The tide had overtaken and surrounded him, and the voices of the girls and
      the children were like the roar of the waters in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was this? Why had they stopped singing? All at once he became
      aware that everybody else was seated, and that he was standing alone on
      the edge of the platform with Glory&rsquo;s letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; There was a strained silence, and he tried to recollect what
      it was that he was expected to do. Every eye was on his face. Some of the
      strangers opened note-books and sat ready to write. Then, coming to
      himself, he understood what was before him, and tried to control his voice
      and begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; he said, but he was hardly able to speak or breathe. &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; he
      said again, but his strong voice shook, and he tried in vain to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the girls began to sob. Then another and another. It was said
      afterward that nobody could look on his drawn face, so hopeless, so full
      of the traces of suffering and bitter sadness, without wanting to cry
      aloud. But he controlled himself at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friends all, you came to-night to bid me Godspeed on a long
      journey and I came to bid you farewell. But there is a higher power that
      rules our actions, and it is little we know of our own future, or our fate
      or ourselves. God bids me tell you that my leper island is to be London,
      and that my work among you is not done yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After saying this he stood a moment as if intending to say more, but he
      said nothing. The letter crinkled in his fingers, he looked at it, an
      expression of helplessness came into his face, and he sat down. And then
      the Father came up to him and sat beside him, and took his hand and
      comforted it as if he had been a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another attempt to sing, but the hymn made no headway this time,
      for some of the girls were crying, they hardly knew why, and others were
      whispering, and the strangers were leaving the room. Two ladies were going
      down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt sure he wouldn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. I had my private reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Rosa Macquarrie. Going down the dark lane she came upon a woman who
      had haunted the outside of the building during the past half hour,
      apparently thinking at one moment of entering and at the next of going
      away. The woman hurriedly lowered her veil as Rosa approached her, but she
      was too late to avoid recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory! Is it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory covered her face with her hands and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Rosa. Oh, I&rsquo;m a lost woman! Lord forgive me, what have I
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me home, Rosa. And don&rsquo;t leave me to-night, dear&mdash;not to-night,
      Rosa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Rosa took her by the arm and led her back to Clement&rsquo;s Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning before daybreak the brothers of the Society of the Holy
      Gethsemane had gathered in their church in Bishopsgate Street for Lauds
      and Prime. Only the chancel was lighted up, the rest of the church was
      dark, but the first gleams of dawn, were now struggling through the
      eastern window against the candlelight on the altar and the gaslight on
      the choir.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was standing on the altar steps and the Father was by his side.
      He was wearing the cassock of the Brotherhood, and the cord with the three
      knots was bound about his waist. All was silent round about, the city was
      still asleep, the current of life had not yet awakened for the day. Lauds
      and Prime were over, the brothers were on their knees, and the Father was
      reading the last words of the dedication service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen! Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a stroke of the bell overhead, a door somewhere was loudly
      slammed, and then the organ began to play:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.
</pre>
    <p>
      The brothers rose and sang, their voices filled the dark place, and the
      quivering sounds of the organ swelled up to the unseen roof.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Holy, Holy, Holy! Merciful and Mighty,
  God in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!
</pre>
    <p>
      The Father&rsquo;s cheeks were moist, but his eyes were shining and his face was
      full of a great joy. John Storm was standing with bowed head. He had made
      the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and surrendered his life to
      God.

    <p>
      Six months passed, and a panic terror had seized London. It was one of
      those epidemic frenzies which have fallen upon great cities in former ages
      of the world. The public mind was filled with the idea that London was
      threatened with a serious danger; that it was verging on an awful crisis;
      that it was about to be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signs were such as have usually been considered preparatory to the
      second coming of the Messiah&mdash;a shock of earthquake which threw down
      a tottering chimney (somewhere in Soho), and the expected appearance of a
      comet. But this was not to be the second Advent; it was to be a disaster
      confined to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      God was about to punish London for its sins. The dishonour lay at its door
      of being the wickedest city in the world. Side by side with the
      development of mechanical science lifting men to the power and position of
      angels, there was a moral degeneration degrading them to the level of
      beasts. With an apparent aspiration after social and humanitarian reform,
      there was a corruption of the public conscience and a hardening of the
      public heart. London was the living picture of this startling contrast.
      Impiety, iniquity, impurity, and injustice were at their height here, and
      either England must forfeit her position among the nations, or the
      Almighty would interpose. The Almighty was about to interpose, and the
      consummation of London&rsquo;s wickedness was near.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what means the destruction of London would come to pass was a matter on
      which there were many theories, and the fear and consternation of the
      people took various shapes. One of them was that of a mighty earthquake,
      in which the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s was to totter and the towers of
      Westminster Abbey to rock and fall amid clouds of dust. Another was that
      of an avenging fire, in which the great city was to light up the whole
      face of Europe and burn to ashes as a witness of God&rsquo;s wrath at the sins
      of men. A third was that of a flood, in which the Thames was to rise and
      submerge the city, and tens of thousands of houses and hundreds of
      thousands of persons were to be washed away and destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the time of the event, the popular imagination had attained to
      a more definite idea. It was to occur on the great day of the Epsom races.
      Derby Day was the national day. More than any day associated with
      political independence, or with victory in battle, or yet with religious
      sanctity, the day devoted to sport and gambling and intemperance and
      immorality was England&rsquo;s day. Therefore the Almighty had selected that day
      for the awful revelation by which he would make his power known to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the heart of London was once more stormed, and shame and panic ran
      through it like an epidemic. The consequences were the usual ones. In vain
      the newspapers published articles in derision of the madness, with
      accounts of similar frenzies which had laid hold of London before. There
      was a run on the banks, men sold their businesses, dissolved their
      partnerships, transferred their stocks, and removed to houses outside the
      suburbs. Great losses were sustained in all ranks of society, and the only
      class known to escape were the Jews on the Exchange, who held their peace
      and profited by their infidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When people asked themselves who the author and origin of the panic was
      they thought instantly and with one accord of a dark-eyed, lonely man, who
      walked the streets of London in the black cassock of a monk, with the cord
      and three knots which were the witness of life vows. No dress could have
      shown to better advantage his dark-brown face and tall figure. Something
      majestic seemed to hang about the man. His big lustrous eyes, his faint
      smile with its sad expression always behind it, his silence, his reserve,
      his burning eloquence when he preached&mdash;seemed to lay siege to the
      imagination of the populace, and especially to take hold as with a fiery
      grip of the impassioned souls of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain mystery about his life did much to help this extraordinary
      fascination. When London as a whole became conscious of him it was
      understood that he was in some sort a nobleman as well as a priest, and
      had renounced the pleasures and possessions of the world and given up all
      for God. His life was devoted to the poor and outcast, especially to the
      Magdalenes and their unhappy children. Although a detached monk still and
      living in obedience to the rule of one of the monastic brotherhoods of the
      Anglican Church, he was also vicar of a parish in Westminster. His church
      was a centre of religious life in that abandoned district, having no fewer
      than thirty parochial organizations connected with it, including guilds,
      clubs, temperance societies, savings banks, and, above all, shelters and
      orphanages for the girls and their little ones, who were the vicar&rsquo;s
      especial care.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chief helpers were a company of devoted women, drawn mainly from the
      fashionable fringe which skirted his squalid district and banded together
      as a Sisterhood. For clerical help he depended entirely on the brothers of
      his society, and the money saved by these voluntary agencies he
      distributed among the poor, the sick, and the unfortunate. Money of his
      own he had none, and his purse was always empty by reason of his
      free-handedness. Rumour spoke of a fortune of many thousands which had
      been spent wholly on others in the building or maintenance of school and
      hospital, shelter and refuge. He lived a life of more than Christian
      simplicity, and was seen to treat himself with constant disregard of
      comfort and convenience. His only home was two rooms (formerly assigned to
      the choir) on the ground floor under his church, and it was understood
      that he slept on a hospital bed, wrapped in the cloak which in winter he
      wore over his cassock. His personal servant in these cell-like quarters
      was a lay brother from his society&mdash;a big ungainly boy with sprawling
      features who served him and loved him and looked up to him with the
      devotion of a dog. A dog of other kind he had also&mdash;a bloodhound,
      whose affection for him was a terror to all who awakened its jealousy or
      provoked its master&rsquo;s wrath. People said he had learned renunciation and
      was the most Christlike man they had ever known. He was called &ldquo;The
      Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the man with whom the popular imagination associated the idea of
      the panic, but what specific ground there was for laying upon him the
      responsibility of the precise predictions which led to it none could
      rightly say. It was remembered afterward that every new folly had been
      ascribed to him. &ldquo;The Father says so and so,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Father says such and
      such will come to pass,&rdquo; and then came prophecies which were the remotest
      from his thoughts. No matter how wild or extravagant the assertion, if it
      was laid upon him there were people ready to believe it, so deep was the
      impression made on the public mind by this priest in the black cassock
      with the bloodhound at his heels, so strong was the assurance that he was
      a man with the breath of God in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was known with certainty was that the Father preached against the
      impurities and injustices of the age with a vehemence never heard before,
      and that when he spoke of the wickedness of the world toward woman, of the
      temptations that were laid before her&mdash;temptations of dress, of
      luxury, of false work and false fame&mdash;and then of the cruel neglect
      and abandonment of woman when her summer had gone and her winter had come,
      his lips seemed to be touched as by a live coal from the altar and his
      eyes to blaze as with Pentecostal fire. Cities and nations which
      countenanced and upheld such corruptions of a false civilization would be
      overtaken by the judgment of God. That judgment was near, it was imminent;
      and but for the many instances in which the life of the rich, the great,
      and the powerful was redeemed by the highest virtue, this pitiful farce of
      a national existence would have been played out already; but for the good
      men still found in Sodom, the city of abominations must long since have
      been destroyed. People there were to laugh at these predictions, but they
      were only throwing cold water on lime; the more they did so the more it
      smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little a supernatural atmosphere gathered about the Father as a
      man sent from God. One day he visited a child who was sick with a bad
      mouth, and touching the child&rsquo;s mouth he said, &ldquo;It will be well soon.&rdquo; The
      child recovered immediately, and the idea started that he was a healer.
      People waited for him that they might touch his hand. Sometimes after
      service he had to stand half an hour while the congregation filed past
      him. Hard-headed persons, sane and acute in other relations of life, were
      heard to protest that on shaking hands with him an electric current passed
      through them. Sick people declared themselves cured by the sight of him,
      and charlatans sold handkerchiefs on pretence that he had blessed them. He
      repeatedly protested that it was not necessary to touch or even to see
      him. &ldquo;Your faith alone can make you whole.&rdquo; But the frenzy increased, the
      people crowded upon him and he was followed through the streets for his
      blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody discovered that he was born on the 25th of December, and was just
      thirty-three years of age. Then the madness reached its height. A certain
      resemblance was observed in his face and head to the traditional head and
      face of Christ, and it was the humour of the populace to discover some
      mystical relations between him and the divine figure. Hysterical women
      kissed his hand and even hailed him as their Saviour. He protested and
      remonstrated, but all to no purpose. The delusion grew, and his
      protestations helped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day approached that was to be big with the fate of London, his
      church, which had been crowded before, was now besieged. He was understood
      to preach the hope that in the calamity to befall the city a remnant would
      be saved, as Israel was saved from the plagues of Egypt. Thousands who
      were too poor to leave London had determined to spend the night of the
      fateful day in the open air, and already they were going out into the
      fields and the parks, to Hampstead, Highgate, and Blackheath. The panic
      was becoming terrible and the newspapers were calling upon the authorities
      to intervene. A danger to the public peace was threatened, and the man who
      was chiefly to blame for it should be dealt with at once. No matter that
      he was innocent of active sedition, no matter that he was living a life
      devoted to religious and humanitarian reforms, no matter that his vivid
      faith, his trust in God, and his obedience to the divine will were like a
      light shining in a dark place, no matter that he was not guilty of the
      wild extravagance of the predictions of his followers&mdash;&ldquo;the Father&rdquo;
       was a peril, he was a panic-maker, and he should be arrested and
      restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of Derby Day broke gray and dull and close. It was one of
      those mornings in summer which portend a thunderstorm and great heat. In
      that atmosphere London awoke to two great fevers&mdash;the fever of
      superstitious fear and the fever of gambling and sport.

    <p>
      But London is a monster with many hearts; it is capable of various
      emotions, and even at that feverish time it was at the full tide of a
      sensation of a different kind entirely. This was a new play and a new
      player. The play was &ldquo;risky&rdquo;; it was understood to present the fallen
      woman in her naked reality, and not as a soiled dove or sentimental
      plaything. The player was the actress who performed this part. She was new
      to the stage, and little was known of her, but it was whispered that she
      had something in common with the character she personated. Her success had
      been instantaneous: her photograph was in the shop windows, it had been
      reproduced in the illustrated papers, she had sat to famous artists, and
      her portrait in oils was on the line at Burlington House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play was the latest work of the Scandinavian dramatist, the actress
      was Glory Quayle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of Derby Day Glory was waiting in the
      drawing-room of the Garden House, dressed in a magnificent outdoor costume
      of pale gray which seemed to wave like a ripe hayfield. She looked paler
      and more nervous than before, and sometimes she glanced at the clock on
      the mantelpiece and sometimes looked away in the distance before her while
      she drew on her long white gloves and buttoned them. Rosa Macquarrie came
      upstairs hurriedly. She was smartly dressed in black with red roses and
      looked bright and brisk and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has sent Benson with the carriage to ask us to drive down,&rdquo; said Rosa.
      &ldquo;Must have some engagement surely. Let us be off, dear. No time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go, I wonder?&rdquo; said Glory, with a strange gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed yes, dear. Why not? You&rsquo;ve not been in good spirits lately, and it
      will do you good. Besides, you deserve a holiday after a six months&rsquo; 
      season. And then it&rsquo;s such a great day for <i>him</i>, too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Glory, and at that moment a twitch of her
      nervous fingers broke a button off one of the gloves. She drew it off,
      threw both gloves on to a side table, took up another pair that lay there,
      and followed Rosa downstairs. An open carriage was waiting for them in the
      outer court of the inn, and ten minutes afterward they drew up in a narrow
      street off Whitehall under a wide archway which opened into the large and
      silent quadrangle leading to the principal public offices. It was the Home
      Office; the carriage had come for Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake had seen changes in his life too. His father was dead and he had
      succeeded to the baronetcy. He had also inherited a racing establishment
      which the family had long upheld, and a colt which had been entered for
      the Derby nearly three years ago was to run in the race that day. Its name
      was Ellan Vannin, and it was not a favourite. Notwithstanding the change
      in his fortunes, Drake still held his position of private secretary to the
      Secretary of State, but it was understood that he was shortly to enter
      public life under the wing of the Government, and to stand for the first
      constituency that became vacant. Ministers predicted a career for him;
      there was nothing he might not aspire to, and hardly anything he might not
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parliament had adjourned in honour of the day on which the &ldquo;Isthmian
      games&rdquo; were celebrated, and the Home Secretary, as leader of the Lower
      House, had said that horse-racing was &ldquo;a noble and distinguished sport
      deserving of a national holiday.&rdquo; But the Minister himself, and
      consequently his secretary, had been compelled to put in an appearance at
      their office for all that. There was urgent business demanding prompt
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the large green room of the Home Office overlooking the empty
      quadrangle, the Minister, dressed in a paddock coat, received a deputation
      of six clergymen. It included Archdeacon Wealthy, who served as its
      spokesman. In a rotund voice, strutting a step and swinging his glasses,
      the Archdeacon stated their case. They had come, most reluctantly and with
      a sense of pain and grief and humiliation, to make representations about a
      brother clergyman. It was the notorious Mr. Storm&mdash;&ldquo;Father&rdquo; Storm,
      for he was drawing the people into the Roman obedience. The man was
      bringing religion into ridicule and contempt, and it was the duty of all
      who loved their mother Church&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Archdeacon, we have nothing to do with that,&rdquo; said the
      Minister. &ldquo;You should go to your Bishop. Surely he is the proper person&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been, sir,&rdquo; said the Archdeacon, and then followed an explanation
      of the Bishop&rsquo;s powerlessness. The Church provided no funds to protect a
      Bishop from legal proceedings in inhibiting a vicar guilty of this
      ridiculous kind of conduct. &ldquo;But the man comes within the power of the
      secular authorities, sir. He is constantly inciting people to assemble
      unlawfully to the danger of the public peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is a fanatic, a lunatic, and has put out monstrous and
      ridiculous predictions about the destruction of London, causing disorderly
      crowds to assemble about his church. The thoroughfares are blocked, and
      people are pushed about and assaulted. Indeed, things have come to such a
      pass that now&mdash;to-day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me again, Mr. Archdeacon, but this seems to be a simple matter for
      the police. Why didn&rsquo;t you go to the Commissioner at Scotland Yard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did, sir, but he said&mdash;you will hardly believe it, but he
      actually affirmed&mdash;that as the man had been guilty of no overt act of
      sedition&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely&mdash;that would be my view too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are we, sir, to wait for a riot, for death, for murder, before the
      law can be put in motion? Is there no precedent for proceeding before
      anything serious&mdash;I may say alarming&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Minister, glancing impatiently at his watch,
      &ldquo;I can only promise you that the matter shall have proper attention. The
      Commissioner shall be seen, and if a summons&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late for that now, sir. The man is a dangerous madman and
      should be arrested and put under restraint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I don&rsquo;t quite see what he has done; but if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Archdeacon drew himself up. &ldquo;Because a clergyman is well connected&mdash;has
      high official connections indeed&mdash;&mdash;But surely it is better that
      one man should be put under control, whoever he is, than that the whole
      Church and nation should be endangered and disgraced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;&mdash;H&rsquo;m!&mdash;&mdash;H&rsquo;m! I think I&rsquo;ve heard that sentiment
      before somewhere, Mr. Archdeacon. But I&rsquo;ll not detain you now. If a
      warrant is necessary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and with vague promises and plausible
      speeches the Minister bowed the deputation out of the room. Then he pisht
      and pshawed, swung a field glass across his shoulder, and prepared to
      leave for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound them! How these Christians love each other! I leave it with you,
      Drake. When the matter was mentioned at Downing Street the Prime Minister
      told us to act without regard to his interest in the young priest. If
      there&rsquo;s likely to be a riot let the Commissioner get his warrant&mdash;Heigho!
      Ten-thirty! I&rsquo;m off! Good-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes afterward Drake himself, having written to Scotland Yard,
      followed his chief down the private staircase to the quadrangle, where
      Glory and Rosa were waiting in the carriage under the arch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In honour of the event in which his horse was to play a part, Drake had
      engaged a coach to take a party of friends to the Downs. They assembled at
      a hotel in the Buckingham Palace Road. Lord Robert was there, dressed in
      the latest fashion, with boots of approved Parisian shape and a necktie of
      crying colours. Betty Bellman was with him, in a red and white dress and a
      large red hat. There was a lady in pale green with a light bonnet, another
      in gray and white, and another in brightest blue. They were a large,
      smart, and even gorgeous company, chiefly theatrical. Before eleven
      o&rsquo;clock they were spinning along the Kennington Road on their way to
      Epsom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake himself drove and Glory occupied the seat of honour by his side. She
      was looking brighter now, and was smiling and laughing and making little
      sallies in response to her companion&rsquo;s talk. He was telling her all about
      the carnival. The Derby was the greatest race the world over. It was run
      for about six thousand sovereigns, but the total turnover of the meeting
      was probably a million of money. Thus on its business side alone it was a
      great national enterprise, and the puritans who would abolish it ought to
      think of that. A race-horse cost about three hundred a year to keep, but
      of course nobody maintained his racing establishment on his winnings.
      Nearly everybody had to bet, and gambling was not so great an offence as
      some people supposed. The whole trade of the world was of the nature of a
      gamble, life itself was a gamble, and the race-course was the only market
      in the world where no man could afford to go bankrupt, or be a defaulter
      and refuse to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now going by Clapham Common with an unbroken stream of vehicles
      of every sort&mdash;coaches with outriders, landaus, hansom cabs,
      omnibuses, costers&rsquo; spring carts and barrows. Every coach carried its
      horn, and every horn was blown at the approach to every village. The sun
      was hot, and the roads were rising to the horses&rsquo; fetlocks in dust. Drake
      was pointing out some of their travelling companions. That large coach
      going by at a furious gallop was the coach of the Army and Navy Club; that
      barouche with its pair of grays and its postilion belonged to a well-known
      wine merchant; that carriage with its couple of leaders worth hundreds
      apiece was the property of a prosperous publican; that was the coach which
      usually ran between Northumberland Avenue and Virginia Water, and its
      seats were let out at so much apiece, usually to clerks who practised
      innocent frauds to escape from the city; those soldiers on the omnibus
      were from Wellington Barracks on &ldquo;Derby leave&rdquo;; and those jolly tars with
      their sweethearts, packed like herrings in a car, were the only true
      sportsmen on the road and probably hadn&rsquo;t the price of a glass of rum on
      any race of the day. Going by road to the Derby was almost a thing of the
      past; smart people didn&rsquo;t often do it, but it was the best fun anyway, and
      many an old sport tooled his team on the road still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory grew brighter at every mile they covered. Everything pleased or
      amused or astonished her. With the charm born of a vivid interest in life
      she radiated happiness over all the company. Some glimpses of the country
      girl came back, her soul thrilled to the beauty of the world around, and
      she cried out like a child at sight of the chestnut and red hawthorn, and
      at the scent of spring with which the air was laden. From time to time she
      was recognised on the road, people raised their hats to her, and Drake
      made no disguise of his beaming pride. He leaned back to Rosa, who was
      sitting on the seat behind, and whispered, &ldquo;Like herself to-day, isn&rsquo;t
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she be? With all the world at her feet and her future on
      the knees of the gods!&rdquo; said Rosa.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a shade of sadness came over Glory&rsquo;s face, as if the gay world and its
      amusements had not altogether filled a void that was left somewhere in her
      heart. They were drawing up to water the horses at the old &ldquo;Cock&rdquo; at
      Sutton, and a brown-faced woman with big silver earrings and a monster hat
      and feather came up to the coach to tell the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; their fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let us, Glo,&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love it of all things, doncher know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gipsy had held out her hand to Glory. &ldquo;Let me look at your palm,
      pretty lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to cross it with silver first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you kindly! But must I tell you the truth, lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes, mother. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re going to lose money to-day, lady; but never mind, you shall
      be fortunate in the end, and the one you love shall be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; cried the gentlemen in chorus. The ladies tittered,
      and Glory turned to Drake and said, &ldquo;A pair of gloves against Ellan
      Vannin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said Drake, and there was general laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gipsy still held Glory&rsquo;s hand, and looking up at Drake out of the
      corner of her eyes, she said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell you what colour he is, pretty
      lady, but he is young and tall, and, though he is a gorgio, he is the kind
      a Romany girl would die for. Much trouble you&rsquo;ll have with him, and
      because of his foolishness and your own unkindness you&rsquo;ll put seven score
      miles between you. You like to live your life, lady, and as men drown
      their sorrows in drink, so do you drown yours in pleasure. But it will all
      come right at last, lady, and those who envy and hate you now will kiss
      the ground you walk on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glo,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at ye, dearest, listenin&rsquo; to such
      clipperty clapper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory did not recover her composure after this incident until they came
      near the Downs. Meantime the grooms had blown their horns at many villages
      hidden in the verdure of charming hollows, and the coaches had overtaken
      the people who had left London earlier in the day to make the journey
      afoot. Boy tramps, looking tired already&mdash;&ldquo;Wish ye luck, gentlemen&rdquo;;
      fat sailors and mutilated colliers playing organs&mdash;&lsquo;Twas in Trafalgar
      Bay, and Come Whoam to thee Childer and Me; tatterdemalions selling the
      C&rsquo;rect Card-&ldquo;on&rsquo;y fourpence, and I&rsquo;ve slep&rsquo; out on the Downs last night,
      s&rsquo;elp me&rdquo;&mdash;and all the ragged army of the maimed and the miserable
      who hang on the edge of a carnival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among this wreckage, as they skimmed over it on the coach, there was one
      figure more grotesque than the rest, a Polish Jew in his long kaftan and
      his worn Sabbath hat, going along alone, triddle-traddle, in his slippers
      without heels. Lord Robert was at the moment teasing Betty into a pet by
      christening her &ldquo;The Elephant,&rdquo; in allusion to her stoutness. But somebody
      called his attention to the Jew, and he screwed his glass to his eye and
      cried, &ldquo;Father Storm, by Jove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nickname was taken up by other people on the coach, and also by people
      on other coaches, and &ldquo;Father Storm!&rdquo; was thrown at the poor scarecrow as
      a missile from twenty quarters at once. Glory&rsquo;s colour was rising to her
      ears, and Drake was humming a tune to cover her confusion. But Betty was
      asking, &ldquo;Who was Father Storm, if you please?&rdquo; and Lord Robert was saying,
      &ldquo;Bless my stars, this is something new, don&rsquo;t you know! Here&rsquo;s somebody
      who doesn&rsquo;t know Father Storm! Father Storm, my dear Elephant, is the
      prophet, the modern Jonah, who predicts that Nineveh&mdash;that is to say,
      London&mdash;is to be destroyed this very day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be balmy!&rdquo; said Betty, and the lady in blue went into fits of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lord Robert, &ldquo;and all because wicked men like ourselves insist
      on enjoying ourselves on a day like this with pretty people like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he <i>is</i> a cough-drop!&rdquo; said Betty. The lady in blue asked what
      was &ldquo;balmy&rdquo; and a &ldquo;cough-drop,&rdquo; and Lord Robert said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty means that the good Father is crazy&mdash;silly&mdash;stupid&mdash;cracked
      in the head in short&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Glory could bear no more. It was an insult to John Storm to be sat
      upon in judgment by such a woman. With a fiery jet of temper she turned
      about and said, &ldquo;Pity there are not more heads cracked, then, if it would
      only let a little of the light of heaven into them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s like that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Betty, looking round
      significantly, and Lord Robert said, &ldquo;It <i>is</i> like that, dear
      Elephant, and if our charming hurricane will pardon me, I&rsquo;m not surprised
      that the man has broken out as a Messiah, and if the authorities don&rsquo;t
      intervene&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Robert!&rdquo; cried Drake. &ldquo;Listen, everybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were climbing on to the Downs and could hear the deep hum of the
      people on the course. &ldquo;My!&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the lady in blue.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a beehive with the lid off,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed the railway station the people who had come by train poured
      into the road and the coach had to slow down. &ldquo;They must have come from
      the four winds of heaven,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, only wait!&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes afterward everybody drew breath. They were on the top of the
      common and had a full view of the course. It was a vast sea of human
      beings stretched as far as the eye could reach&mdash;a black moving ocean
      without a glimpse of soil or grass. The race track itself was a river of
      people: the Grand Stand, tier on tier, was black from its lawns at the
      bottom to its sloping gallery on top; and the &ldquo;Hill&rdquo; opposite was a rocky
      coast of carriages, booths, carts, and clustering crowds. Glory&rsquo;s eyes
      seemed to leap out of her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nation!&rdquo; she said with panting
      breath. &ldquo;An empire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were diving into these breaking, plashing, plunging waters of human
      life with their multitudinous voices of laughter and speech, and Glory was
      looking at a dark figure in the hollow below which seemed to stand up
      above the rest, when Drake cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit hard, everybody! We&rsquo;ll take the hill at a gallop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then to the crack of the whip, the whoop of the driver, and the blast of
      the horn, the horses flew down like the wind. Betty screamed, Rosa
      groaned, and Glory laughed and looked up at Drake in her delight. When the
      coach drew up on the other side of the hollow, the bell was ringing at the
      Grand Stand as signal for another race, and the dark figure had
      disappeared.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That morning, when John Storm went to take seven-o&rsquo;clock celebration, the
      knocker-up with his long stick had not yet finished his rounds in the
      courts and alleys about the church, but the costers with their barrows and
      donkeys, their wives and their children, were making an early start for
      Epsom. There were many communicants, and it was eight o&rsquo;clock before he
      returned to his rooms. By that time the postman had made his first
      delivery and there was a letter from the Prime Minister. &ldquo;Come to Downing
      Street as soon as this reaches you. I must see you immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ate his breakfast of milk and brown bread, said &ldquo;Good-bye, Brother
      Andrew, I shall be back for evening service,&rdquo; whistled to the dog, and set
      out into the streets. But a sort of superstitious fear had taken hold of
      him, as if an event of supreme importance in his life was impending, and
      before answering his uncle&rsquo;s summons he made a round of the buildings in
      the vicinity which were devoted to the work of his mission. His first
      visit was to the school. The children had assembled, and they were being
      marshalled in order by the Sisters and prepared for their hymn and prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many of them had presents for him&mdash;one a flower, another a biscuit,
      another a marble, and yet another an old Christmas card. &ldquo;God bless them,
      and protect them!&rdquo; he thought, and he left the school with a full heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      His last visit was to the men&rsquo;s shelter which he had established under the
      management of his former &ldquo;organ man,&rdquo; Mr. Jupe. It was a bare place, a
      shed which had been a stable and was now floored and ceiled. Beds
      resembling the bunks in the foc&rsquo;s&rsquo;le of a ship lined the walls. When these
      were full the lodgers lay on the ground. A blanket only was provided. The
      men slept in their clothes, but rolled up their coats for pillows. There
      was a stove where they might cook their food if they had money to buy any.
      A ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of tea and sugar mixed, a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of bread, and a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth
      of butter made a royal feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going through the square in which his church stood he passed a smart gig
      at the door of a public-house that occupied the corner of a street. The
      publican in holiday clothes was stepping up to the driver&rsquo;s seat, and a
      young soldier, smoking a cigarette, was taking the place by his side.
      &ldquo;Morning, Father, can you tip us the winner?&rdquo; said the publican with a
      grin, while the soldier, with an impudent smile, cried &ldquo;Ta-ta&rdquo; over his
      shoulder to the second story of a tenement house, where a young woman with
      a bloated and serious face and a head mopped up in curl-papers was looking
      down from an open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine o&rsquo;clock when John Storm reached the Prime Minister&rsquo;s house. A
      small crowd of people had followed him to the door. &ldquo;His lordship is
      waiting for you in the garden, sir,&rdquo; said the footman, and John was
      conducted to the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a shady little inclosure between Downing Street and the Horse Guards
      Parade the Prime Minister was pacing to and fro. His head was bent, his
      step was heavy, he looked harassed and depressed. At sight of John&rsquo;s
      monkish habit he started with surprise and faltered uneasily. But
      presently, sitting by John&rsquo;s side on a seat under a tree, and keeping his
      eyes away from him, he resumed their old relations and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent for you, my boy, to warn you and counsel you. You must give up
      this crusade. It is a public danger, and God knows what harm may come of
      it! Don&rsquo;t suppose I do not sympathize with you. I do&mdash;to a certain
      extent. And don&rsquo;t think I charge you with all the follies of this
      ridiculous distemper. I have followed you and watched you, and I know that
      ninety-nine hundredths of this madness is not yours. But in the eye of the
      public you are responsible for the whole of it, and that is the way of the
      world always. Enthusiasm is a good thing, my boy; it is the rainbow in the
      heaven of youth, but it may go too far. It may be hurtful to the man who
      nourishes it and dangerous to society. The world classes it with lunacy
      and love and so forth among the nervous accidents of life; and the humdrum
      healthy-minded herd always call that man a fool and a weakling or else a
      fanatic and a madman, in whom the grand errors of human nature are due to
      an effort&mdash;may I not say, a vain effort?&mdash;to live up to a great
      ideal.&rdquo; There were nervous twitchings over the muscles of John&rsquo;s face.
      &ldquo;Come, now, come, for the sake of peace and tranquillity, lest there
      should be disorder and even death, let this matter rest. Think, my boy,
      think, we are as much concerned for the world&rsquo;s welfare as you can be, and
      we have higher claims and heavier responsibilities. I can not raise a hand
      to help you, John. In the nature of things I can not defend you. I sent
      for you because&mdash;because you are your mother&rsquo;s son. Don&rsquo;t cast on me
      a heavier burden than I can bear. Save yourself and spare me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish me to do, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave London immediately and stay away until this tumult has settled
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is impossible, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite impossible, and though I did not make these predictions about the
      destruction of London, yet I believe we are on the eve of a great change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and if you had not sent for me I should have called on you, to ask
      you to set aside a day for public prayer that God may in his mercy avert
      the calamity that is coming or direct it to the salvation of his servants.
      The morality of the nation is on the decline, uncle, and when morality is
      lacking the end is not far off. England is given up to idleness, pomp,
      dissolute practices, and pleasure&mdash;pleasure, always pleasure. The
      vice of intemperance, the mania for gambling, these are the vultures that
      are consuming the vitals of our people. Look at the luxury of the country&mdash;a
      ludicrous travesty of national greatness! Look at the tastes and habits of
      our age&mdash;the deadliest enemies of true religion! And then look at the
      price we are paying in what the devil calls &lsquo;the priestesses of society&rsquo; 
      for the tranquillity of the demon of lust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my boy, my dear boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, uncle, yes, I know, I know, many humanitarian schemes are afloat
      and we think we are not indifferent to the condition of the poor. But
      contrast the toiling women of East London with the idlers of Hyde Park in
      a London season. Other nations have professed well with their lips while
      their hearts have been set on wealth and pleasure. And they have fallen!
      Yes, sir, in ancient Asia as well as in modern Europe they have always
      fallen. And unless we unglue ourselves from the vanities which imperil our
      existence we shall fall too. The lust of pleasure and the lust of wealth
      bring their own revenges. In the nation as well as the individual the
      Almighty destroys them as of old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True&mdash;true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how can I hold my peace or run away while it is the duty of
      Christians, of patriots, to cry out against this danger? On the soul of
      every one of us the duty rests, and who am I that I should escape from it?
      Oh, if the Church only realized her responsibility, if she only kept her
      eyes open&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has powerful reasons for keeping them closed, my son,&rdquo; said the
      Minister, &ldquo;and always will have until the Establishment is done away with.
      It is coming to that some day, but meantime have a care. The clergy are
      not your friends, John. Statesmen know too well the clerical cruelty which
      shelters itself behind the secular arm. It is an old story, I think, and
      you may find instances of that also in your ancient Palestine. But beware,
      my boy, beware&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. Ye know that it hated me
      before it hated you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exaltation of John&rsquo;s manner was increasing, and again the Prime
      Minister became uneasy, as if fearing that the young monk by his side
      would ask him next to kneel and pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;I suppose there is no help for it, and
      matters must take their own course.&rdquo; Then he broke into other subjects,
      talked of his brother, John&rsquo;s father, whom he had lately heard from. His
      health was failing, he could not last very long; a letter from his son now
      might make all things well.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was silent, his head was down, but the Prime Minister could see that
      his words took no effect. Then his bleak old face smiled a wintry smile as
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not mending much in one way, my boy. Do you know you&rsquo;ve never
      once been here since the day you came to tell me you were to be married,
      and intended to follow in the footsteps of Father Damien?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John flinched, and the muscles of his face twitched nervously again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was an impossible enterprise, John. No wonder the lady couldn&rsquo;t
      suffer you to follow it. But she might have allowed you to see a lonely
      old kinsman for all that.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s pale face was breaking, and his breath
      was coming fast. &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; taking his arm, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not reproaching you,
      John. There are passions of the soul which eat up all the rest, I know
      that quite well, and when a man is under the sway of them he has neither
      father nor uncle, neither kith nor kin. Good-bye! ... Ah, this way out&mdash;this
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footman had stepped up to the Minister and whispered something about a
      crowd in front of the house, and John was passed out of the garden by the
      back door into the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours afterward the frequenters of Epsom racecourse saw a man in a
      black cassock get up into an unoccupied wagonette and make ready to speak.
      He was on the breast of &ldquo;The Hill,&rdquo; directly facing the Grand Stand, in a
      close pack of carriages, four-in-hands, landaus, and hansoms, filled with
      gaily dressed women in pink and yellow costumes, drinking champagne and
      eating sandwiches, and being waited upon by footmen in livery. It was the
      interval between two events of the race meeting, and beyond the labyrinth
      of vehicles there was a line of betting men in outer garments of blue silk
      and green alpaca, standing on stools under huge umbrellas and calling the
      odds to motley crowds of sweltering people on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men and women,&rdquo; he began, and five thousand faces seemed to rise at the
      sound of his voice. The bookmakers kept up their nasal cries of &ldquo;I lay on
      the field!&rdquo; &ldquo;Five to-one bar one!&rdquo; But the crowd turned and deserted them.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Father,&rdquo; &ldquo;Father Storm,&rdquo; the people said, with laughter and
      chuckling, loose jests and some swearing, but they came up to him with one
      accord until the space about, him, as far as to the roadway by which
      carriages climbed the hill, was an unbroken pavement of rippling faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Father!&rdquo; and then laughter. &ldquo;What abart the end of the world,
      old gel?&rdquo; and then references to &ldquo;the petticoats&rdquo; and more laughter.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ere, I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave five bob each way, Resurrection,&rdquo; and shrieks of wilder
      laughter still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preacher stood for some moments silent and unshaken. Then the quiet
      dignity of the man and the love of fair play in the crowd secured him a
      hearing. He began amid general silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it is contrary to regulations to stand here to speak, but
      I am risking that for the urgency of the hour and message. Men and women,
      you are here under false pretences. You pretend to yourselves and to each
      other that you have come out of a love of sport, but you have not done so,
      and you know it. Sport is a plausible pleasure; to love horses and take
      delight in their fleetness is a pardonable vanity, but you are here to
      practise an unpardonable vice. You have come to gamble, and your gambling
      is attended by every form of intemperance and immorality. I am not afraid
      to tell you so, for God has laid upon me a plain message, and I intend to
      do my duty. These race-courses are not for horse-racing, but for
      reservoirs of avarice and drunkenness and prostitution. Don&rsquo;t think&rdquo;&mdash;he
      was looking straight into the painted faces of the women in pink and
      yellow, who were trying to smile and look amused&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t think I am
      going to abuse the unhappy girls who are forced by a corrupt civilization
      to live by their looks. They are my friends, and half my own life is spent
      among them. I have known some of them in whose hearts dwelt heavenly
      purity, and when I think of what they have suffered from men I feel
      ashamed that I am a man. But, my sisters, for you, too, I have an urgent
      message. It is full summer with you now, as you sit here in your gay
      clothes on this bright day; but the winter is coming for every one of you,
      when there will be no more sunshine, no more luxury and pleasure and
      flattery, and when the miry wallowers in troughs and stys, who are now
      taking the best years of your lives from you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helloa there! Whoop! Tarara-ra-ra-rara!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A four-in-hand coach was dashing headlong up the hill amid clouds of dust,
      the rattling of wheels, the shouts of the driver and the blasts of the
      horn, and the people who covered the roadway were surging forward to make
      room for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gloria!&rdquo; said everybody, looking up at the occupants of the coach
      and recognising one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell of the preacher was broken. He paused and turned his head and
      saw Glory. She was sitting tall and bright and gay on the box-seat by the
      side of Drake; the rays of the sun were on her and she was smiling up into
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preacher began again, then faltered, and then stopped. A bell at the
      Grand Stand was ringing. &ldquo;Numbers goin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; said everybody, and before
      any one could be conscious of what was happening, John Storm was only a
      cipher in the throng, and the crowd was melting away.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The great carnival completely restored Glory&rsquo;s spirits. She laughed and
      cried out constantly and lived from minute to minute like a child.
      Everybody recognised her and nearly everybody saluted her. Drake beamed
      with pride and delight. He took her about the course, answered her
      questions, punctuated her jests, and explained everything, leaving Lord
      Robert to entertain his guests. Who were &ldquo;those dwellers in tents&rdquo;? They
      were the Guards&rsquo; Club, and the service was also represented by artillery
      men, king&rsquo;s hussars, and a line regiment from Aldershot. This was called
      &ldquo;The Hill,&rdquo; where jovial rascaldom, usually swarmed, looking out for stray
      overcoats and the lids of luncheon dishes left unprotected on carriages.
      Yes, the pickpocket, the card-sharper, the &ldquo;lumberer,&rdquo; the confidence man,
      the blarneying beggar, and the fakir of every description laid his snares
      on this holy spot. In fact, this is his Sanctuary and he peddles under the
      eye of the police. &ldquo;Holy Land?&rdquo; Ha, ha! &ldquo;All the patriarchs out of the
      Bible here?&rdquo; Oh, the vociferous gentlemen with patriarchal names in
      velveteen coats under the banners and canvas sign-boards&mdash;Moses,
      Aaron, and so forth? They were the &ldquo;bookies,&rdquo; otherwise bookmakers,
      generally Jews and sometimes Welshers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, come along, some of you sportsmen! I ain&rsquo;t made the price of my
      railway fare, s&rsquo;elp me!&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dead cert, gents.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t afford to buy
      thick &lsquo;uns at four quid apiece!&rdquo; &ldquo;Five to one on the field!&rdquo; &ldquo;I lay on the
      field!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A &ldquo;thick un?&rdquo; Oh, that was a sovereign, half a thick un half a sovereign,
      twenty-five pounds a &ldquo;pony,&rdquo; five hundred a &ldquo;monkey,&rdquo; flash notes were
      &ldquo;stumers,&rdquo; and a bookmaker who couldn&rsquo;t pay was &ldquo;a Welsher.&rdquo; That? That
      was &ldquo;the great Brockton,&rdquo; gentleman and tipster. &ldquo;Amusement enough!&rdquo; Yes,
      niggers, harpists, Christy Minstrels, strong men, acrobats, agile clowns
      and girls on stilts, and all the ragamuffins from &ldquo;the Burrer,&rdquo; bent on
      &ldquo;making a bit.&rdquo; African Jungle? A shooting gallery with model lions and
      bears. Fine Art Exhibition? A picture of the hanging of recent murderers.
      Boxing Ring? Yes, for women&mdash;they strip to the waist and fight like
      fiends. Then look at the lady auctioneer selling brass sovereigns a penny
      apiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy one, gentlemen, and see what they&rsquo;re like, so as the &lsquo;bookies&rsquo; can&rsquo;t
      pawse &lsquo;em on ye unawares!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Food enough!&rdquo; Yes, at Margett&rsquo;s, Patton&rsquo;s, Hatton&rsquo;s, and &ldquo;The Three
      Brooms,&rdquo; as well as the barrows for stewed eels, hard-boiled eggs,
      trotters, coker-nuts, winkles, oysters, cockles, and all the luxuries of
      the New Cut. Why were they calling that dog &ldquo;Cookshop&rdquo;? Because he was
      pretty sure to go there in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had ploughed over some quarter of a mile of the
      hillside, fighting their way among the carriages that stood six deep along
      the rails and through a seething mass of ruffianism, in a stifling
      atmosphere polluted by the smell of ale and the reeking breath of tipsy
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoo! I feel like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego rolled into one,&rdquo; said
      Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go into the Paddock,&rdquo; said Drake, and they began to cross the race
      track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t that somebody preaching as we galloped down the hill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it? I didn&rsquo;t notice,&rdquo; and they struggled through.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fresh and cool under the trees, and Glory thought it cheap even at
      ten shillings a head to walk for ten minutes on green grass. Horses
      waiting for their race were being walked about in clothes with their names
      worked on the quarter sheets, and breeders, trainers, jockeys, and clerks
      of the course mingled with gentlemen in silk hats and ladies in smart
      costumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake&rsquo;s horse was a big bay colt, very thin, almost gaunt, and with long,
      high-stepping legs. The trainer was waiting for a last word with his
      owner. He was cool and confident. &ldquo;Never better or fitter, Sir Francis,
      and one of the grandest three-year-olds that ever looked through a bridle.
      Improved wonderful since he got over his dental troubles, and does justice
      to the contents of his manger. Capital field, sir, but it&rsquo;s got to run up
      against summat smart to-day. Favourite, sir? Pooh! A coach horse! Not
      stripping well&mdash;light in the flank and tucked up. But this colt fills
      the eye as a first-class one should. Whatever beats him will win, sir,
      take my word for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the jockey, standing by in his black-and-white-jacket, wagged his head
      and said in a cheery whisper: &ldquo;Have what ye like on &lsquo;im, Sir Francis.
      Great horse, sir! Got a Derby in &lsquo;im or I&rsquo;m a Slowcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake laughed at their predictions, and Glory patted the creature while it
      beat its white feet on the ground and the leather of its saddle squeaked.
      The club stand from there? looked like a sea of foaming laces, feathers,
      flowers, and sunshades. They turned to go to it, passing first by the
      judge&rsquo;s box, whereof Drake explained the use, then through the Jockey Club
      inclosure, which was full of peers, peeresses, judges, members of
      Parliament, and other turfites, and finally through the betting ring where
      some hundreds of betting men of the superior class proclaimed their
      calling in loud voices and loud clothes and the gold letters on their
      betting books. To one of these pencillers Drake said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the figure for Ellan Vannin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten to one, market price, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you in hundreds,&rdquo; said Drake, and they struggled through the
      throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going up the stairs Glory said: &ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t the Archdeacon at your office
      this morning? We saw him coming out of the square with Mr. Golightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did you? How hot it is to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? I feel as if I should like to play Ariel in gossamer&mdash;But
      wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble about that, Glory. It&rsquo;s an old, story that religious
      intolerance likes to throw the responsibility of its acts on the civil
      government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then John Storm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in no danger yet&mdash;none whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how glorious!&rdquo; They had reached the balcony, and Glory was pretending
      that the change in her voice and manner came of delight at the sudden
      view. She stood for a moment spellbound, and then leaned over the rail and
      looked through the dazzling haze that was rising from the vast crowd
      below. Not a foot of turf was to be seen for a mile around, save where at
      the jockeys&rsquo; gate a space was kept clear by the police. It was a moving
      mass of humanity, and a low, indistinguishable murmur was coming up from
      it such as the sea makes on the headlands above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud had died off Glory&rsquo;s face and her eyes were sparkling. &ldquo;What a
      wonderfully happy world it must be, after all!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the standard was hoisted over the royal stand to indicate that
      the Prince had arrived. Immediately afterward there was a silent movement
      of hats on the lawns below the boxes, and then somebody down there began
      to sing God save the Queen. The people on the Grand Stand took up the
      chorus, then the people on the course joined in, then the people on &ldquo;The
      Hill,&rdquo; until finally the whole multitude sang the national hymn in a voice
      that was like the voice of an ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s eyes were now full of tears, she was struggling with a desire to
      cry aloud, and Drake, who was watching her smallest action, stood before
      her to screen her from the glances of gorgeously attired ladies who were
      giggling and looking through lorgnettes. The fine flower of the
      aristocracy was present in force, and the club stand was full of the great
      ladies who took an interest in sport and even kept studs of their own.
      Oriental potentates were among them in suits of blue and gold, and the
      French language was being spoken on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory attracted attention and Drake&rsquo;s face beamed with delight. An
      illustrious personage asked to be introduced to her, and said he had seen
      her first performance and predicted her extraordinary success. She did not
      flinch. There was a slight tremor, a scarcely perceptible twitching of the
      lip, and then she bore her honours as if she had been born to them. The
      Prince entertained a party to luncheon, and Drake and Glory were invited
      to join it. All the smart people were there, and they looked like a
      horticultural exhibition of cream colour and rose pink and gray. Glory
      kept watching the great ones of the earth, and she found them very
      amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think?&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think most people at the Derby must have the wrong make-up on. That
      gentleman, now&mdash;he ought to be done up as a stable-boy. And that lady
      in mauve&mdash;she&rsquo;s a ballet girl really, only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; But Glory whispered, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go round the corner
      and laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat between Drake and a ponderous gentleman with a great beard like a
      waterfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the odds against the colt, Drake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake answered, and Glory recalled herself from her studies and said, &ldquo;Oh,
      yes, what did you say it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prohibitive price&mdash;for you.&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I&rsquo;m going to do a flutter on my own, you know, and plunge
      against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was explained to her that only bookmakers bet against horses, but the
      gentleman with the beard volunteered to reverse positions, and take
      Glory&rsquo;s ten to one against Ellan Vannin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;in thick &lsquo;uns, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the meaning of this running after strange gods?&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, sir! Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and then the bell rang for the race of the day, and they scurried back to
      the Stand. The numbers were going up and a line of fifty policemen abreast
      were clearing the course. Some of the party had come over from the coach,
      and Lord Robert was jotting down in a notebook the particulars of betting
      commissions for his fair companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am I to be honoured with a commission from the Hurricane?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what&rsquo;s the price for Ellan Vannin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down to five to one, pretty lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me one to five that he&rsquo;s going to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what in the world are you doing, Glory?&rdquo; said Drake. His eyes were
      dancing with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Running a race with that old man in the box which can find a loser
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the horses were sent out for the preliminary canter and
      parade before the royal stand, and a tingling electrical atmosphere seemed
      to come from somewhere and set every tongue wagging. It seemed as if
      something unexpected was about to occur, and countless eyes went up to the
      place where Drake stood with Glory by his side. He was outwardly calm, but
      with a proud flush under his pallor; she was visibly excited, and could
      not stand on the same spot for many seconds together. By this time the
      noise made by the bookmakers in the inclosure below was like that of ten
      thousand sea fowl on a reef of rock, and Glory was trying to speak above
      the deafening clangour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silver and gold have I none, but if I had&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A white flag had fallen as signal for the start, there was a hollow roar
      from the starting post, and people were shouting, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; Then
      there was a sudden silence, a dead hush&mdash;below, above, around,
      everywhere, and all eyes, all glasses, all lorgnettes were turned in the
      direction of the runners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses got well away and raced up the hill like cavalry charging in
      line; then at the mile post the favourite drew to the front, and the
      others went after him in an indistinguishable mass. But the descent seemed
      not to his liking; he twisted a good deal, and the jockey was seen sawing
      the reins and almost hanging over the horse&rsquo;s head. When the racers swung
      round Tattenham Corner and came up like mice in the distance, it was seen
      that another horse had taken advantage of an opening and was overhauling
      the favourite with a tremendous rush. His colours were white and black. It
      was Ellan Vannin. From that moment Drake&rsquo;s horse never relinquished his
      advantage, but came down the straight like a great bird with his wings
      ceasing to flap, passed the Stand amid great excitement, and won
      handsomely by a length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the roar of delight that went up from the crowd Glory, with her
      hand on Drake&rsquo;s shoulder, was seen to be crying, laughing, and cheering at
      the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> lost,&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother that!&rdquo; she said, and when the jockey had slipped from his
      saddle, and Drake had taken his horse into the weighing-room and the &ldquo;All
      right!&rdquo; was shouted, she started the cheering again and said she meant to
      make a dead heat of it with Tennyson&rsquo;s brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you bet against me?&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You silly boy,&rdquo; she answered with a crow of happiness and gaiety, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
      the gipsy tell me I should lose money to-day? And how could I bet on your
      horse unless you lost the race?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake laughed merrily at her delicious duplicity and could hardly resist
      an impulse to take her in his arms and kiss her. Meantime his friends were
      slapping him on the back and people were crushing up to offer him
      congratulations. He turned to take his horse into the Paddock, and Lord
      Robert took Glory down after him. The trainer and jockey were there,
      looking proud and happy, and Drake, with a pale and triumphant face, was
      walking the great creature about as if reluctant to part with it. It was
      breathing heavily, and sweat stood in drops on its throat, head, and ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you beauty! How I should love to ride you!&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But dare you?&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare I! Only give me the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, by&mdash;&mdash;I will, or it won&rsquo;t be my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somebody brought champagne and Glory had to drink a bumper to &ldquo;the best
      horse of the century, bar none.&rdquo; Then her glass was filled afresh and she
      had to drink to the owner, &ldquo;the best fellow on earth, bar none,&rdquo; and again
      she was compelled to drink &ldquo;to the best bit of history ever made at Epsom,
      bar none.&rdquo; With that she was excused while the men drank at Drake&rsquo;s
      proposal &ldquo;to the loveliest, liveliest, leeriest little woman in the world,
      God bless her!&rdquo; and she hid her face in her hands and said with a merry
      laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me when it&rsquo;s over, boys, and I&rsquo;ll come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Drake had despatched telegrams and been bombarded by interviewers,
      he led the way back to the coach on the Hill, and the company prepared for
      their return. The sun had now gone, a thick veil of stagnant clouds had
      gathered over it, the sky looked sulky, and Glory&rsquo;s head tad begun to ache
      between the eyes. Rosa was to go home by train in order to reach her
      office early, and Glory half wished to accompany her. But an understudy
      was to play her part that night and she had no excuse. The coach wormed
      its way through the close pack of vehicles at the top of the Hill and
      began to follow the ebbing tide of humanity back to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about my pair of gloves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a hard man, reaping where you have not sowed and gathering&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, then, we&rsquo;re quits,&rdquo; said Drake, leaning over from the box seat and
      snatching a kiss of her. It was now clear that he had been drinking a good
      deal.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Before the race had been run, a solitary man with a dog at his heels had
      crossed the Downs on his way back to the railway station. Jealousy and
      rage possessed his heart between them, but he would not recognise these
      passions; he believed his emotions to be horror and pity and shame. John
      Storm had seen Glory on the race-course, in Drake&rsquo;s company, under Drake&rsquo;s
      protection: he proud and triumphant, she bright and gay and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, help me! Help me, O Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, dragging along the road, in his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw her again as
      the victim of this man, his plaything, his pastime to takeup or leave&mdash;no
      better than any of the women about her, and where they were going she
      would go also. Some day he would find her where he had found others&mdash;outcast,
      deserted, forlorn, lost; down in the trough of life, a thing of loathing
      and contempt!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, help her! Help her, O Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were few passengers by the train going back to London, nearly all
      traffic at this hour being the other way, and there was no one else in the
      compartment he occupied. He threw himself down in a corner, consumed with
      indignation and a strange sense of dishonour. Again he saw her bright
      eyes, her red lips&mdash;the glow of her whole radiant face and a paroxysm
      of jealousy tore his heart to pieces. Glory was his. Though a bottomless
      abyss was yawning between them, her soul belonged to him, and a great
      upheaval of hatred for the man who possessed her body surged up to his
      throat. Against all this his pride as well as his religion rebelled. He
      crushed it down, and tried to turn his mind to another current of ideas.
      How could he save her? If she should go down to perdition, his remorse
      would be worse to bear than flames of fire and brimstone. The more
      unworthy she was, the more reason he should strive to rescue her soul from
      the pangs of eternal torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rattling of the carriage broke in upon these visions, and he got up
      and paced to and fro like a bear in a cage. And, like a bear with its
      slow, strong grip, he seemed to be holding her in his wrath and saying:
      &ldquo;You shall not destroy yourself; you shall not, you shall not, for I, I, I
      forbid it!&rdquo; Then he sank back in his seat, exhausted by the conflict which
      made his soul a battlefield of spiritual and sensual passions. Every limb
      shook and quivered. He began to be afraid of himself, and he felt an
      impulse to fly away somewhere. When he alighted at Victoria his teeth were
      chattering, although the atmosphere was stifling and the sky was now heavy
      with black and lowering clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid the eyes of the people who usually followed him in the streets,
      he cut through a narrow thoroughfare and went back to Brown&rsquo;s Square by
      way of the park. But the park was like a vast camp. Thousands of people
      seemed to cover the grass as far as the eye could reach, and droves of
      workmen, followed by their wives and children, were trudging to other open
      spaces farther out. It was the panic terror. Afterward it was calculated
      that fifty thousand persons from all parts of London had quitted the
      doomed city that day to await the expected catastrophe under the open sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of fierce passion had faded from his face by the time he reached
      his church, but there another ordeal awaited him. Though it still wanted
      an hour of the time of evening service a great crowd had gathered in the
      square. He tried to escape observation, but the people pressed upon him,
      some to shake his hand, others to touch his cassock, and many to kneel at
      his feet and even to cover them with kisses. With a sense of shame and
      hypocrisy he disengaged himself at length, and joined Brother Andrew in
      the sacristy. The simple fellow was full of marvellous stories. There had
      been wondrous manifestations of the workings of the Holy Spirit during the
      day. The knocker-up, who was a lame man, had shaken hands with the Father
      on his way home that morning, and now he had thrown away his stick and was
      walking firmly and praising God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was large and rectangular and plain, and looked a well-used
      edifice, open every day and all day. The congregation was visibly excited,
      but the service appeared to calm them. The ritual was full, with
      procession and incense, but without vestments, and otherwise monastic in
      its severity. John Storm preached. The epistle for the day had been from
      First Corinthians, and he took his text from that source also: &ldquo;Deliver
      him up to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be
      saved in the day of the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      People said afterward that they had never heard anything like that sermon.
      It was delivered in a voice that was low and tremulous with emotion. The
      subject was love. Love was the first inheritance that God had given to his
      creatures&mdash;the purest and highest, the sweetest and best. But man had
      degraded and debased it, at the temptation of Satan and the lust of the
      world. The expulsion of our first parents from Eden was only the poetic
      figure of what had happened through all the ages. It was happening now&mdash;and
      London, the modern Sodom, would as surely pay its penalty as did the
      cities of the ancient East. No need to think of flood or fire or tempest&mdash;of
      any given day or hour. The judgment that would fall on England, like the
      plagues that fell on Egypt, would be of a kind with the offence. She had
      wronged the spirit of love, and who knows but God would punish her by
      taking out of the family of man the passion by which she fell, lifting it
      away with all that pertained to it&mdash;good and bad, spiritual and
      sensual, holy and corrupt?
    </p>
    <p>
      The burning heat clouds of the day seemed to have descended into the
      church, and in the gathering darkness the preacher, his face just visible,
      with its eyes full of smouldering fire, drew an awful picture of the world
      under the effects of such a curse. A place without unselfishness, without
      self-sacrifice, without heroism, without chivalry, without loyalty,
      without laughter, and without children! Every man standing alone,
      isolated, self-centred, self-cursed, outlawed, loveless, marriageless,
      going headlong to degeneracy and death! Such might be God&rsquo;s punishment on
      this cruel and wicked city for its sensual sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the preacher lost control of his imagination and swept his hearers
      along with him as he fabricated horrible fancies. The people were
      terror-stricken, and not until the last hymn was given out did they
      recover the colour of their blanched faces. Then they sang as with one
      voice, and after the benediction had been pronounced and they were surging
      down the aisles in close packs, they started the hymn again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when they had left the church they could not disperse. Out in the
      square were the thousands who had not been able to get inside the doors,
      and every moment the vast proportions of the crowd were swelled. The
      ground was covered, the windows round about were thrown up and full of
      faces, and people had clambered on to the railings of the church, and even
      on to the roofs of the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody went to the sacristy and told the Father what was happening
      outside. He was now like a man beside himself, and going out on to the
      steps of the church where he could be seen by all, he lifted his hands and
      pronounced a prayer in a sonorous and fervent voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long, O Lord, how long? From the bosom of God, where thou reposest,
      look down on the world where thou didst walk as a man. Didst thou not
      teach us to pray &lsquo;Thy kingdom come&rsquo;? Didst thou not say thy kingdom was
      near; that some who stood with thee should not taste of death till they
      had seen it come with power; that when it came the poor should be blessed,
      the hungry should be fed, the blind should see, the heavy-laden should
      find rest, and the will of thy Father should be done on earth even as it
      is done in heaven? But nigh upon two thousand years lave gone, O Lord, and
      thy kingdom hath not come. In thy name now doth the Pharisee give alms in
      the streets to the sound of a trumpet going before him. In thy name now
      doth the Levite pass by on the other side when a man has fallen among
      thieves. In thy name now doth the priest buy and sell the glad tidings of
      the kingdom, giving for the gospel of God the commandments of men, living
      in rich men&rsquo;s houses, faring sumptuously every day, praying with his lips,
      &lsquo;Give us this day our daily bread,&rsquo; but saying to his; soul: &lsquo;Soul, thou
      hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and
      be merry.&rsquo; How long, O Lord, how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had John Storm stepped back when the heavy clouds broke into
      mutterings of thunder. So low were the sounds at first that in the general
      tumult they were scarcely noticed; but they came again and again, louder
      and louder with every fresh reverberation, and then the excitement of the
      people became intense and terrible. It was as if the heavens themselves
      had spoken to give sign and assurance of the calamity that had been
      foretold.
    </p>
    <p>
      First a woman began to scream as if in the pains of labour. Then a young
      girl cried out for mercy, and accused herself of countless and nameless
      offences. Then the entire crowd seemed to burst into sobs and moans and
      agonizing expressions of despair, mingled with shouts of wild laughter and
      mad thanksgiving. &ldquo;Pardon, pardon!&rdquo; &ldquo;O Jesus, save me!&rdquo; &ldquo;O Saviour of
      sinners!&rdquo; &ldquo;O God, have mercy upon me!&rdquo; &ldquo;O my heart, my heart!&rdquo; Some threw
      themselves on the ground, stiff and motionless and insensible as dead men.
      Others stood over the stricken people and prayed for their relief from the
      power of Satan. Others fell into convulsions, and yet others, with wild
      and staring eyes, rejoiced in their own salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now almost dark and some of the people who had been out to the
      Derby were returning home in their gigs and coster&rsquo;s carts, laughing,
      singing, and nearly all of them drunk. There were wild encounters. A young
      soldier (it was Charlie Wilkes) came upon Pincher the pawnbroker. &ldquo;Wot
      tcher, myte? Wot&rsquo;s yer amoosemint now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, you evil liver, you gambler, you son of Belial!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stou thet now&mdash;d&rsquo;ye want a kepple er black eyes or a pench on the
      nowze?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At nine o&rsquo;clock the police of Westminster, being unable to disperse the
      crowd, seat to Scotland Yard for the mounted constabulary.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meantime the man who was the first cause of the tumult sat alone in his
      cell-like chamber under the church, a bare room without carpet or rug, and
      having no furniture except a block bed, a small washstand, two chairs, a
      table, a prayer stool and crucifix, and a print of the Virgin and Child.
      He heard the singing of the people outside, but it brought him neither
      inspiration nor comfort. Nature could no longer withstand the strain he
      had put upon it, and he was in deep dejection. It was one of those moments
      of revulsion which comes to the strongest soul when at the crown or near
      the crown of his expectations he asks himself, &ldquo;What is the good?&rdquo; A flood
      of tender recollections was coming over him. He was thinking of the past,
      the happy past, the past of love and innocence which he had spent with
      Glory, of the little green isle in the Irish Sea, and of all the sweetness
      of the days they had passed together before she had fallen to the
      temptations of the world and he had become the victim of his hard if lofty
      fate. Oh, why had he denied himself the joys that came to all others? To
      what end had he given up the rewards of life which the poorest and the
      weakest and the meanest of men may share? Love, woman&rsquo;s love, why had he
      turned his back upon it? Why had he sacrificed himself? O God, if, indeed,
      it were all in vain!
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Andrew put his head in at the half-open door. His brother, the
      pawnbroker, was there and had something to say to the Father. Pincher&rsquo;s
      face looked over Andrew&rsquo;s shoulder. The muscles of the man&rsquo;s eyes were
      convulsed by religious mania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just sold my biziness, sir, and we &lsquo;aven&rsquo;t a roof to cover us now!&rdquo;
       he cried, in the tone of one who had done something heroic.
    </p>
    <p>
      John asked him what was to become of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, sir, ain&rsquo;t it the beginning of the end? That&rsquo;s the gawspel, ain&rsquo;t
      it? &lsquo;The foxes hev &lsquo;oles and the birds of the air hev nests&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then close behind the man, interrupting him and pushing him aside,
      there came another with fixed and staring eyes, crying: &ldquo;Look &lsquo;ere,
      Father! Look! Twenty years I &lsquo;obbled on a stick, and look at me now!
      Praise the Lawd, I&rsquo;m cured, en&rsquo; no bloomin&rsquo; errer! I&rsquo;m a brand as was
      plucked from the burnin&rsquo; when my werry ends &lsquo;ad caught the flames! Praise
      the Lawd, amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John rebuked them and turned them out of the room, but he was almost in as
      great a frenzy. When he had shut the door his mind went back to thoughts
      of Glory. She, too, was hurrying to the doom that was coming on all this
      wicked city. He had tried to save her from it, but he had failed. What
      could he do now? He felt a desire to do something, something else,
      something extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on the end of the bed he began again to recall Glory&rsquo;s face as he
      had seen it at the race-course. And now it came to him as a shock after
      his visions of her early girlhood. He thought there was a certain
      vulgarity in it which, he had not observed before&mdash;a slight
      coarsening of its expression, an indescribable degeneracy even under the
      glow of its developed beauty. With her full red lips and curving throat
      and dancing eyes, she was smiling into the face of the man who was sitting
      by her side. Her smile was a significant smile, and the bright and eager
      look with which the man answered it was as full of meaning. He could read
      their thoughts. What had happened? Were all barriers broken down? Was
      everything understood between them?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the final madness, and he leaped to his feet in an outburst of
      uncontrollable rage. All at once he shuddered with a feeling that
      something terrible was brewing within him. He felt cold, a shiver was
      running over his whole body. But the thought he had been in search of had
      come to him of itself. It came first as a shock, and with a sense of
      indescribable dread, but it had taken hold of him and hurried him away. He
      had remembered his text: &ldquo;Deliver him up to Satan for the destruction of
      the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;it is in the Holy Book itself. There is the
      authority of St. Paul for it. Clearly the early Christians countenanced
      and practised such things.&rdquo; But then came a spasm of physical pain. That
      beautiful life, so full of love and loveliness, radiating joy and
      sweetness and charm! The thing was impossible! It was monstrous! &ldquo;Am I
      going mad?&rdquo; he asked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he began to be sorry for himself as well as for Glory. How could
      he live in the world without her? Although he had lost her, although an
      impassable gulf divided them, although he had not seen her for six months
      until today, yet it was something to know she was alive and that he could
      go at night to the place where she was and look up and think, &ldquo;She is
      there.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, I am going mad,&rdquo; he thought, and he trembled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind oscillated among these conflicting ideas, until the more hideous
      thought returned to him of Drake and the smile exchanged with Glory. Then
      the blood rushed to his head, and strong emotions paralyzed his reason.
      When he asked himself if it was right in England and in the nineteenth
      century to contemplate a course which might have been proper to Palestine
      and the first century, the answer came instantaneously that it <i>was</i>
      right. Glory was in peril. She was tottering on the verge of hell. It
      would not be wrong, but a noble duty, to prevent the possibility of such a
      hideous catastrophe. Better a life ended than a life degraded and a soul
      destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this the sophism worked. It was true that he would lose her; she would
      be gone from him, she who was all his joy, his vision by day, his dream by
      night. But could he be so selfish as to keep her in the flesh, and thus
      expose her soul to eternal torment? And after all she would be his in the
      other world, his forever, his alone. Nay, in this world also, for being
      dead he would love her still. &ldquo;But, O God, must <i>I</i> do it?&rdquo; he asked
      himself at one moment, and at the next came his answer: &ldquo;Yes, yes, for I
      am God&rsquo;s minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That sent him back to his text again. &ldquo;Deliver him up to <i>Satan</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       But there was a marginal reference to Timothy, and he turned it up with a
      trembling hand. <i>Satan</i> again, but the Revised Version gave &ldquo;the
      Lord&rsquo;s servant,&rdquo; and thus the text should read, &ldquo;Deliver him up to the
      Lord&rsquo;s servant for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be
      saved in the day of the Lord.&rdquo; This made him cry out. He drank it in with
      inebriate delight. The thing was irrevocably decided. He was justified, he
      was authorized, he was the instrument of a fixed purpose. No other
      consideration could move him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time his heart and temples were beating violently, and he felt as
      if he were being carried up into a burning cloud. Before his eyes rose the
      vision of Isaiah, the meek lamb converted into an inexorable avenger
      descending from the summit of Edom. It was right to shed blood at the
      divine command&mdash;nay, it was necessary, it was inevitable. And as God
      had commanded Abraham to take the life of Isaac, whom he loved, so did God
      call on him, John Storm, to take the life of Glory that he might save her
      from the risk of everlasting damnation!
    </p>
    <p>
      There may have been intervals in which his sense of hearing left him, for
      it was only now that he became conscious that somebody was calling to him
      from the other side of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anybody there?&rdquo; he asked, and a voice replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart, yes, this five minutes and better, but I didna dare come in,
      thinking surely there was somebody talking with you. Is there no somebody
      here then? No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Callender, who was carrying a small glad-stone bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, it&rsquo;s myself, and sorry I am to be bringing bad news to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, but his tone betrayed complete indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door and answered in a whisper: &ldquo;A warrant! I much misdoubt
      but there&rsquo;s one made out for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, what does the man want? But come, laddie, come; you must tak&rsquo; 
      yoursel&rsquo; off to some spot till the storm blows over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have work to do, auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work! You&rsquo;ve worked too much already&mdash;that&rsquo;s half the botherment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s work, auntie, and it must be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then God will do it himself, without asking the life of a good man, or
      he&rsquo;s no just what I&rsquo;ve been takin&rsquo; him for. But see,&rdquo; opening the bag and
      whispering again, &ldquo;your auld coat and hat! I found them in your puir auld
      room that you&rsquo;ll no come back to. You&rsquo;ve been looking like another body so
      long that naebody will ken you when you&rsquo;re like yoursel&rsquo; again. Come, now,
      off with these lang, ugly things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can not go, auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not. While God commands me I will do my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, but men are kittle cattle! I&rsquo;ve often called you my ain son, but if I
      were your ain mother I ken fine what I&rsquo;d do with you&mdash;I&rsquo;d just slap
      you and mak&rsquo; you. I&rsquo;ll leave the clothes, anyway. Maybe you&rsquo;ll be thinking
      better of it when I&rsquo;m gone. Good-night to you. Your puir head&rsquo;s that hot
      and moidered&mdash;-But what&rsquo;s wrang with you, John, man? What&rsquo;s come over
      ye anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be hardly conscious of her presence, and after standing a
      moment at the door, looking back at him with eyes of love and pity, she
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been asking himself for the first time how he was to carry out his
      design. Sitting on the end of the bed with his head propped on his hand he
      felt as if he were in the hold of a great ship, listening to the plash and
      roar of the stormy sea outside. The excitement of the populace was now
      ungovernable and the air was filled with groans and cries. He would have
      to pass through the people, and they would see him and detain him, or
      perhaps follow him. His impatience was now feverish. The thing he had to
      do must be done to-night, it must be done immediately. But it was
      necessary in the first place to creep out unseen. How was he to do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to himself he had a vague sense of some one wishing him
      good-night. &ldquo;Oh, good-night, good-night!&rdquo; he cried with an apologetic
      gesture. But he was alone in the room, and on turning about he saw the bag
      on the floor, and remembered everything. Then a strange thing happened.
      Two conflicting emotions took hold of him at once&mdash;the first an
      enthusiastic, religious ecstasy, the other a low, criminal cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was intended. He was only the instrument of a fixed purpose.
      These clothes were proof of it. They came to his hand at the very moment
      when they were wanted, when nothing else would have helped him. And Mrs.
      Callender had been the blind agent in a higher hand to carry out the
      divine commands. Fly away and hide himself? God did not intend it. A
      warrant? No matter if it sent him like Cranmer to the stake. But this was
      a different thing entirely, this was God&rsquo;s will and purpose, this&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet even while thinking so he laughed an evil laugh, tore the clothes out
      of the bag with trembling hands, and made ready to put them on. He had
      removed his cassock when some one opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he cried in a husky growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only me,&rdquo; said a timid voice, and Brother Andrew entered, looking pale
      and frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you! Come in; close the door; I&rsquo;ve something to say to you. Listen!
      I&rsquo;m going out, and I don&rsquo;t know when I shall be back. Where&rsquo;s the dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the passage, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chain him up at the back, lest he should get out and follow me. Put this
      cassock away, and if anybody asks for me say you don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ve
      gone&mdash;you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but are you well, Brother Storm? You look as if you had just been
      running.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hand-glass on the washstand, and John snatched it up and
      glanced into it and put it down again instantly. His nostrils were
      quivering, his eyes were ablaze, and the expression of his face was
      shocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they doing outside? See if I can get away without being
      recognised,&rdquo; and Brother Andrew went out to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage from the chambers under the church was into a dark and narrow
      street at the back, but even there a group of people had gathered,
      attracted by the lights in the windows. Their voices could be heard
      through the door which Brother Andrew had left ajar, and John stood behind
      it and listened. They were talking of himself&mdash;praising him, blessing
      him, telling stories of his holy life and gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Andrew reported that most of the people were at the front, and
      they were frantic with religious excitement. Women were crushing up to the
      rail which the Father had leaned his head upon for a moment after he had
      finished his prayer, in order to press their handkerchiefs and shawls on
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nobody would know you now, Brother Storm&mdash;even your face is
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John laughed again, but he turned off the lights, thinking to drive away
      the few who were still lingering in the back street. The ruse succeeded.
      Then the man of God went out on his high errand, crept out, stole out,
      sneaked out, precisely as if he had been a criminal on his way to commit a
      crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed the lanes and narrow streets and alleys behind the Abbey, past
      the &ldquo;Bell,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Boar&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Arms&rdquo;&mdash;taverns that
      have borne the same names since the days when Westminster was Sanctuary.
      People home from the races were going into them with their red ties awry,
      with sprigs of lilac in their buttonholes; and oak leaves in their hats.
      The air was full of drunken singing, sounds of quarrelling, shameful words
      and curses. There were some mutterings of thunder and occasional flashes
      of lightning, and over all there was the deep hum of the crowd in the
      church square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the bottom of Parliament Street he was almost run down by a
      squadron of mounted police who were trotting into Broad Sanctuary. To
      escape observation he turned on to the Embankment and walked under the
      walls of the gardens of Whitehall, past the back of Charing Cross station
      to the street going up from the Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate of Clement&rsquo;s Inn was closed, and the porter had to come out of
      his lodge to open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Garden House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Garden House, sir? Inner court left-hand corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John passed through. &ldquo;That will be remembered afterward,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;But
      no matter&mdash;it will all be over then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And coming out of the close streets, with their clatter of traffic, into
      the cool gardens, with their odour of moistened grass, the dull glow in
      the sky, and the glimpse of the stars through the tree-tops, his mind went
      back by a sudden bound to another night, when he had walked over the same
      spot with Glory. At that there came a spasm of tenderness, and his throat
      thickened. He could almost see her, and feel her by his side, with her
      fragrant freshness and buoyant step. &ldquo;O God! must I do it, must I, must
      I?&rdquo; he thought again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But another memory of that night came back to him; he heard Drake&rsquo;s voice
      as it floated over the quiet place. Then the same upheaval of hatred which
      he had felt before he felt again. The man was the girl&rsquo;s ruin; he had
      tempted her by love of dress, of fame, of the world&rsquo;s vanities and follies
      of every sort. This made him think for the first time of how he might find
      her. He might find her with <i>him</i>. They would come back from the
      Derby together. He would bring her home, and they would sup in company.
      The house would be lit up; the windows thrown open; they would be playing
      and singing and laughing, and the sounds of their merriment would come
      down to him into the darkness below.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the better, all the better! He would do it before the man&rsquo;s face. And
      when it was done, when all was over, when she lay there&mdash;lay there&mdash;there&mdash;he
      would turn on the man and say: &ldquo;Look at her, the sweetest girl that ever
      breathed the breath of life, the dearest, truest woman in all the world!
      You have done that&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;and God damn you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tortured heart was afire, and his brain was reeling. Before he knew
      where he was he had passed from the outer court into the inner one. &ldquo;Here
      it is&mdash;this is the house,&rdquo; he thought. But it was all dark. Just a
      few lights burning, but they had been carefully turned down. The windows
      were closed, the blinds were drawn, and there was not a sound anywhere! He
      stood some minutes trying to think, and during that time the mood of
      frenzy left him and the low cunning came back. Then he rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, so he rang again. After a while he heard a footstep
      that seemed to come up from below. Still the door was not opened, and he
      rang a third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; said a voice within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I&mdash;open the door,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said the voice, and he replied impatiently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Liza, open, and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the catch lock was shot back. At the next moment he was in the hall,
      shutting the door behind him, and Liza was looking up into his face with
      eyes of mingled fear and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, sir, whyever didn&rsquo;t you say it was you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to the office, and won&rsquo;t be back till morning. And Miss Gloria isn&rsquo;t
      home from the races yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see her to-night&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me, sir&mdash;Farver, I mean&mdash;but I wouldn&rsquo;t a-known
      your voice, it seemed so different. And me that sleepy too, being on the
      go since six in the mornin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to bed, Liza. You sleep in the kitchen, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, thank you, I think I will, too. Miss Gloria can let herself in,
      anyway, same as comin&rsquo; from the theatre. But can I git ye anythink? No?
      Well, you know your wye up, sir, down&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; good-night, Liza!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Farver!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had set his foot on the stair to go up to the drawing-room when it
      suddenly occurred to him that though he was the minister of God he was
      using the weapons of the devil. No matter! If he had been about to commit
      a crime it would have been different. But this was no crime, and he was no
      criminal. He was the instrument of God&rsquo;s mercy to the woman he loved. <i>He
      was going to slay her body that he might save her soul!</i>

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The journey home from the Derby had been a long one, but Glory had enjoyed
      it. When she had settled down to the physical discomfort of the blinding
      and choking dust, the humours of the road became amusing. This endless
      procession of good-humoured ruffianism sweeping through the most sacred
      retreats of Nature, this inroad of every order of the Stygian <i>demi-monde</i>
      on to the slopes of Olympus, was intensely interesting. Men and women
      merry with drink, all laughing, shouting, and singing; some in fine
      clothes and lounging in carriages, others in striped jerseys and yellow
      cotton dresses, huddled up on donkey barrows; some smoking cigarettes and
      cigars and drinking champagne, others smoking clay pipes with the bowls
      downward, and flourishing bottles of ale; some holding rhubarb leaves over
      their heads for umbrellas, and pelting the police with <i>confetti</i>;
      others wearing executioners&rsquo; masks, false mustaches, and red-tipped noses,
      and blowing bleating notes out of penny trumpets&mdash;but all one family,
      one company, one class.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were ghastly scenes as well as humorous ones&mdash;an old horse,
      killed by the day&rsquo;s work and thrown into the ditch by the roadside,
      axletrees broken by the heavy loads and people thrown out of their carts
      and cut, boy tramps dragging along like worn-out old men, and a Welsher
      with his clothes torn to ribbons, stealing across the fields to escape a
      yelping and infuriated crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the atmosphere was full of gaiety, and Glory laughed at nearly
      everything. Lord Robert, with his arm about Betty&rsquo;s waist, was chaffing a
      coster who had a drunken woman on his back seat. &ldquo;Got a passenger,
      driver?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yuss, sir, and I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; &lsquo;ome to my wife to-night, and thet&rsquo;s
      more nor you dare do.&rdquo; A young fellow in pearl buttons was tramping along
      with a young girl in a tremendous hat. He snatched her hat off, she
      snatched off his; he kissed her, she smacked his face; he put her hat on
      his own head, she put on his hat; and then they linked arms and sang a
      verse of the Old Dutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory reproduced a part of this love-passage in pantomime, and Drake
      screamed with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was seven o&rsquo;clock before they reached the outskirts of London. By that
      time a hamper on the coach had been emptied and the bottles thrown out;
      the procession had drawn up at a dozen villages on the way; the perspiring
      tipsters, with whom &ldquo;things hadn&rsquo;t panned out well,&rdquo; had forgotten their
      disappointments and &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t care a tinker&rsquo;s! cuss&rdquo;; every woman in a
      barrow had her head-gear in confusion, and she was singing in a drunken
      wail. Nevertheless Drake, who was laughing and talking constantly, said it
      was the quietest Derby night he had ever seen, and he couldn&rsquo;t tell what
      things were coming to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be this religious mania, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; said lord Robert, pointing
      to a new and very different scene which they had just then come upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an open space covered with people, who had lit fires as if
      intending to camp out all night, and were now gathered in many groups,
      singing hymns and praying. The drunken wails from the procession stopped
      for a moment, and there was nothing heard but the whirring wheels and the
      mournful notes of the singers. Then &ldquo;Father Storm!&rdquo; rose like the cry of a
      cormorant from a thousand throats at once. When the laughter that greeted
      the name had subsided, Betty said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my honour, though, that man must be off his dot,&rdquo; and the lady in
      blue went into convulsions of hysterical giggling. Drake looked uneasy,
      and Lord Robert said, &ldquo;Who cares what an Elephant says?&rdquo; But Glory took no
      notice now, save that for a moment the smile died off her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been agreed, when they cracked the head off the last bottle, that
      the company should dine together at the Cafè Royal or Romano&rsquo;s, so they
      drove first to Drake&rsquo;s chambers to brush the dust off and to wash and
      rest. Glory was the first to be ready, and while waiting for the others
      she sat at the organ in the sitting-room and played something. It was the
      hymn they had heard in the suburbs. At this there was laughter from the
      other side of the wall, and Drake, who seemed unable, to lose sight of
      her, came to the door of his room in his shirt sleeves. To cover up her
      confusion she sang a &ldquo;coon&rdquo; song. The company cheered her, and she sang
      another, and yet another. Finally she began My Mammie, but floundered,
      broke down, and cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rehearsal, ten in the morning,&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then everybody laughed, and while Drake busied himself putting Glory&rsquo;s
      cloak on her shoulders, he whispered: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to do, dear? A bit off
      colour to-night, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be a good boy and leave me alone,&rdquo; she answered, and then she laughed
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were on the point of setting out when somebody said, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s late
      for dinner now&mdash;why not supper at the Corinthian Club?&rdquo; At that the
      other ladies cried &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with one voice. There was a dash of daring and
      doubtful propriety in the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you game for it?&rdquo; said Drake, looking at Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she replied, with a merry smile, whereupon he cried &ldquo;All
      right,&rdquo; and a look came into his eyes which she had never seen there
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Corinthian Club was in St. James&rsquo;s Square, a few doors from the
      residence of the Bishop of London. It was now dark, and as they passed
      through Jermyn Street a line of poor children stood by the poulterer&rsquo;s
      shop at the corner waiting for the scraps that are thrown away at closing
      time. York Street was choked with hansoms, but they reached the door at
      last. There were the sounds of music and dancing within. Officials in
      uniform stood in a hall examining the tickets of membership and taking the
      names of guests. The ladies removed their cloaks, the men hung up their
      coats and hats, a large door was thrown open, and they looked into the
      ballroom. The room was full of people as faultlessly dressed as at a house
      in Grosvenor Square. But the women were all young and pretty, and the men
      had no surnames. A long line of gilded youths in dress clothes occupied
      the middle of the floor. Each held by the waist the young man before him
      as if he were going to play leap-frog. &ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; shouted one of them,
      and the band struck up. Then the whole body kicked out right and left,
      while all sang a chorus, consisting chiefly of &ldquo;Tra-la-la-la-la-la!&rdquo; One
      of them was a lord, another a young man who had lately come into a
      fortune, another a light comedian, another belonged to a big firm on the
      Stock Exchange, another was a mystery, and another was one of &ldquo;the boys&rdquo;
       and lived by fleecing all the rest. They were executing a dance from the
      latest burlesque. &ldquo;Hello, there!&rdquo; the conductor shouted again, and the
      band stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert led the way upstairs. Pretty women in light pinks and blues
      sat in every corner of the staircase. There was a balcony from which you
      could look down on the dancers as from the gallery of a playhouse. Also
      there was an American bar where women smoked cigarettes. Lord Robert
      ordered supper, and when the meal was announced they went into the
      supper-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; greeted them as they entered. At little tables lit up by
      pink candles sat small groups of shirt fronts and butterfly ties with fair
      heads and pretty frocks. Waiters were coming and going with champagne and
      silver dishes; there was a clatter of knives and forks, and a jabber of
      voices and laughter. And all the time there came the sounds of the band,
      with the &ldquo;Tra-la-la&rdquo; from the ballroom below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory sat by Drake. She realized that she had lowered herself in his eyes
      by coming there. He was drinking a good deal and paying her endless
      compliments. From time to time the tables about them were vacated and
      filled again by similar shirt fronts and fair heads. People were arriving
      from the Derby, and the talk was of the day&rsquo;s racing. Some of the new
      arrivals saluted Drake, and many of them looked at Glory. &ldquo;A rippin&rsquo; good
      race, old chappie. Didn&rsquo;t suit my book exactly, but the bookies will have
      smiling faces at Tattersall&rsquo;s on Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man with a big beard at the next table pulled down his white waistcoat,
      lifted his glass, and said, &ldquo;To Gloria!&rdquo; It was her acquaintance of the
      race-course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Blue Beard?&rdquo; she asked in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They call him the Faro King,&rdquo; said Drake. &ldquo;Made all his money by gambling
      in Paris, and now he is a squire with a living in his gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then over the laughter and voices, the band and the singing, with an awful
      suddenness there came a crash of thunder. The band and the comic song
      stopped, and there was a hush for a moment. Then Lord Robert said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder if this is the dreadful storm that is to overwhelm the nation,
      don&rsquo;t you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That fell on the house of frivolity like a second thunderbolt, and people
      began to look up with blanched faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t the first time the <i>storm</i> has howled; it&rsquo;s been
      howling all along,&rdquo; said Lord Robert, but nobody laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the company recovered itself, the bands and the singing were
      heard again, louder and wilder than before, the men shouted for more
      champagne, and nicknamed every waiter &ldquo;Father Storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory was ashamed. With her head on her hand she was looking at the people
      around when the &ldquo;Faro King,&rdquo; who had been making eyes at her, leaned over
      her shoulder and said in a confidential whisper, &ldquo;And what is Gloria
      looking for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am looking for <i>a man</i>,&rdquo; she answered. And as the big beard turned
      away with &ldquo;Oh, confound it!&rdquo; she became aware that Drake and Lord Robert
      were at high words from opposite sides of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I tell you no, no, <i>no</i>!&rdquo; said Drake. &ldquo;Call him a weakling and a
      fool and an ass, if you will, but does that explain everything? This is
      one of the men with the breath of God in him, and you can&rsquo;t judge of him
      by ordinary standards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should think not, indeed, dear chap,&rdquo; said Lord Robert, &ldquo;Common sense
      laughs at the creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse for common sense. When it judges of these isolated
      beings by the standards of the common herd then common sense is always the
      greatest nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! oho!&rdquo; came in several voices, but Drake paid no attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesus Christ himself was mocked at and ridiculed by the common sense of
      his time, by his own people, and even his own family, and his family and
      people and time have been gibbeted by all the centuries that have come
      after them. And so it has been with every ardent soul since who has taken
      up his parable and introduced into the world a new spirit. The world has
      laughed at him and spat upon him, and, only for its fear of the sublime
      banner he has borne, it would have shut him up in a mad-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were strange words in a strange place. Everybody listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these sombre giants are the leaders of the world for all that, and
      one hour of their Divine madness is worth more to humanity than a cycle of
      our sanity. And yet we deny them friendship and love, and do our best to
      put them out of the pale of the human family! We have invented a new name
      for them too&mdash;degenerates&mdash;pygmies and pigs as we are, who ought
      to go down on our knees to them with our faces buried in the dirt!
      Gentlemen,&rdquo; he cried, filling his glass and rising to his feet, &ldquo;I give
      you a toast&mdash;the health of Father Storm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory had sat trembling all over, breathing hard, blushing, and wide-eyed
      until he had done. Then she leaped up to where he stood beside her, threw
      her arms about his neck, and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you ring down quick, my dear,&rdquo; said Betty, and everybody laughed
      a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake was laughing with the rest, and Glory, who had dropped back to her
      seat in confused embarrassment, was trying to laugh too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another bottle of fizz anyway,&rdquo; cried Drake. He had mistaken the meaning
      of Glory&rsquo;s kiss, and was utterly intoxicated by it. She could have cried
      with shame and rage, seeing he thought such conduct came naturally to her
      and perhaps imagined it wasn&rsquo;t the first time she had done as much. But to
      carry off the situation she laughed a good deal with him, and when the
      wine came they jingled glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see you home to-night,&rdquo; he whispered, smiling slyly and
      looking her full in the eyes. She shook her head, but that only provoked
      him to fresh effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must, I will&mdash;you <i>shall</i> allow me,&rdquo; and he began to play
      with her hand and ruffle up the lace that covered her round arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then his man Benson, looking hot and excited, came up to him with a
      message. Glory overheard something about &ldquo;the office,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Secretary,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Scotland Yard.&rdquo; Then Drake turned to her with a smile, over a look of
      vexation, and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, dear&mdash;very&mdash;I must go away for a
      while. Will you stay here until I return, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me out and put me in a cab,&rdquo; said Glory. Their getting up attracted
      attention, and Lord Robert said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it, perhaps, something about that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Drake, and they left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band in the ballroom was still playing the dance out of the burlesque,
      and half a hundred voices were shouting &ldquo;Tra-la-la-la&rdquo; as Glory stepped
      into a hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow on, though,&rdquo; whispered Drake with a merry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall all be in bed, and the house locked up&mdash;&mdash; How
      magnificent you were to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see the man trodden on when he was down&mdash;&mdash; But how
      lovely you&rsquo;ve looked to-day, Glory! I&rsquo;ll get in to-night if I have to ring
      up Liza or break down the door for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the cab crossed Trafalgar Square it had to draw up for a procession of
      people coming up Parliament Street singing hymns. Another and more
      disorderly procession of people, decorated with oak leaves and hawthorns
      and singing a music-hall song, came up and collided with it. A line of
      police broke up both processions; and the hansom passed through.

    <h2>
      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On entering the drawing-room John Storm was seized with a weird feeling of
      dread. The soft air seemed to be filled with Glory&rsquo;s presence and her very
      breath to live in it. On the side-table a lamp was burning under a warm
      red shade. A heap of petty vanities lay about&mdash;articles of silver,
      little trinkets, fans, feathers, and flowers. His footsteps on the soft
      carpet made no noise. It was all so unlike the place he had come from, his
      own bare chamber under the church!
    </p>
    <p>
      He could have fancied that Glory had that moment left the room. The door
      of a little ebony cabinet stood half open and he could see inside. Its
      lower shelves were full of shoes and little dainty slippers, some of them
      of leather, some of satin, some black, some red, some white. They touched
      him with an indescribable tenderness and he turned his eyes away. Under
      the lamp lay a pair of white gloves. One of them was flat and had not been
      worn, but the other was filled out with the impression of a little hand.
      He took it up and laid it across his own big palm, and another wave of
      tenderness broke over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the mantelpiece there were many photographs. Most of them were of Glory
      and some were very beautiful, with their gleaming and glistening eyes and
      their curling and waving hair. One looked even voluptuous with its parted
      lips and smiling mouth; but another was different&mdash;it was so sweet,
      so gay, so artless. He thought it must belong to an earlier period, for
      the dress was such as she used to wear in the days when he knew her first,
      a simple jersey and a sailor&rsquo;s stocking cap. Ah, those days that were
      gone, with their innocence and joy! Glory! His bright, his beautiful
      Glory!
    </p>
    <p>
      His emotion was depriving him of the free use of his faculties, and he
      began to ask himself why he was waiting there. At the next instant came
      the thought of the awful thing he had come to do and it seemed monstrous
      and impossible. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go away,&rdquo; he told himself, and he turned his face
      toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a what-not at the door side of the room another photograph stood in a
      glass stand. His back had been to it, and the soft light of the lamp left
      a great part of the room in obscurity, but he saw it now, and something
      bitter that lay hidden at the bottom of his heart rose to his throat. It
      was a portrait of Drake, and at the sight of it he laughed savagely and
      sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long he sat he never knew. To the soul in torment there is no such
      thing as time; an hour is as much as, eternity and eternity is no more
      than an hour. His head was buried in his arms on the table and he was a
      prey to anguish and doubt. At one time he told himself that God did not
      send men to commit murder; at the next that this was not murder but
      sacrifice. Then a mocking voice in his ears seemed to say, &ldquo;But the world
      will call it murder and the law will punish you.&rdquo; To that he answered in
      his heart: &ldquo;When I leave this house I will deliver myself up. I will go to
      the nearest police court and say &lsquo;Take me, I have done my duty in the eye
      of God, but committed a crime in the eye of my country.&rsquo;&rdquo; And when the
      voice replied, &ldquo;That will only lead to your own death also,&rdquo; he thought,
      &ldquo;Death is a gain to those who die for their cause, and my death will be a
      protest against the degradation of women, a witness against the men who
      make them the creatures of their pleasure, their playthings, their
      victims, and their slaves.&rdquo; Thinking so, he found a strange thrill in the
      idea that all the world would hear of what he had done. &ldquo;But I will say a
      mass for her soul in the morning,&rdquo; he told himself, and a chill came over
      him and his heart grew cold as a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he lifted his head and listened. The room was quiet, there was not a
      sound in the gardens of the Inn, and, through a window which was partly
      open, he could hear the monotonous murmur of the streets outside. A great
      silence seemed to have fallen on London&mdash;a silence more awful than
      all the noise and confused clamour of the evening. &ldquo;It must be late,&rdquo; he
      thought; &ldquo;it must be the middle of the night.&rdquo; Then the thought came to
      him that perhaps, Glory would not come home that night at all, and in a
      sudden outburst of pent-up feeling his heart cried, &ldquo;Thank God! Thank
      God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had said it aloud and the sound of his voice in the silent room&mdash;awakened
      all his faculties. Suddenly he was aware of other sounds outside. There
      was a rumble of wheels and the rattle of a hansom. The hansom came nearer
      and nearer. It stopped in the outside courtyard. There was the noise of a
      curb-chain as if the horse were shaking its head. The doors of the hansom
      opened with a creak and banged back on their spring. A voice, a woman&rsquo;s
      voice, said &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; and another voice, a man&rsquo;s voice, answered,
      &ldquo;Good-night and thank you, miss!&rdquo; Then the cab wheels turned and went off.
      All his senses seemed to have gone into his ears, and in the silence of
      that quiet place he heard everything. He rose to his feet and stood
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment there was the sound of a key in the lock of the door below;
      the rustle of a woman&rsquo;s dress coming up the stairs, an odour of perfume in
      the air, an atmosphere of freshness and health, and then the door of the
      room which had been ajar was swung open and there on the threshold with
      her languid and tired but graceful movements was she herself, Glory. Then
      his head turned giddy and he could neither hear nor see.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Glory saw him standing by the lamp, with his deadly pale face, she
      stood a moment in speechless astonishment, and passed her hand across her
      eyes as if to wipe out a vision. After that she clutched at a chair and
      made a faint cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it you?&rdquo; she said in a voice which she strove to control. &ldquo;How you
      frightened me! Whoever would have thought of seeing you here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was trying to answer, but his tongue would not obey him, and his
      silence alarmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Liza let you in&mdash;where <i>is</i> Liza?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to bed,&rdquo; he said in a thick voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Rosa&mdash;have you seen Rosa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not! How could you? She must be at the office, and won&rsquo;t be
      back for hours. So you see we are quite alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not know why she said that, and, in spite of the voice which she
      tried to render cheerful, her lip trembled. Then she laughed, though there
      was nothing to laugh at, and down at the bottom of her heart she was
      afraid. But she began moving about, trying to make herself easy and
      pretending not to be alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, won&rsquo;t you help me off with my cloak? No? Then I must do it for
      myself I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Throwing off her outer things, she walked across the room and sat down on
      the sofa near to where he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How tired I am! It&rsquo;s been such a day! Once is enough for that sort of
      thing, though! Now where do you think I&rsquo;ve been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where you&rsquo;ve been, Glory&mdash;I saw you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? Really? Then perhaps it <i>was</i> you who&mdash;&mdash;Was it you
      in the hollow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had moved to avoid contact with her, but now, standing by the
      mantelpiece looking into her face, he could not help recognising in the
      fashionable woman at his feet the features of the girl once so dear to
      him, the brilliant eyes, the long lashes, the twitching of the eyelids,
      and the restless movement of the mouth. Then the wave of tenderness came
      sweeping over him again and he felt as if the ground were slipping beneath
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you say your prayers to-night. Glory?&rdquo; he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she answered, trying to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not say them now, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had made her tremble all over, but she got up, walked straight across
      to him, looked intently into his face for a moment, and then said: &ldquo;What
      is the matter? Why are you so pale? You are not well, John!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not well either.&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, John, what does it all mean? What are you thinking of? Why have you
      come here to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save your soul, my child. It is in great, great peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first she took this for the common, everyday language of the devotee,
      but another look into his face banished that interpretation, and her fear
      rose to terror. Nevertheless she talked lightly, hardly knowing what she
      said. &ldquo;Am I, then, so very wicked? Surely Heaven doesn&rsquo;t want me yet,
      John. Some day I trust&mdash;I hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, to-night&mdash;<i>now!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then her cheeks turned pale and her lips became white and bloodless. She
      had returned to the sofa, and half rose from it, then sat back, stretching
      out one hand as if to ward off a blow, but still keeping her eyes riveted
      on his face. Once she looked round to the door and tried to cry out, but
      her voice would not answer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This speechless fright lasted only a moment. Then she was herself again,
      and looked fearlessly up at him. She had the full use of her intellect,
      and her quick instinct went to the root of things. &ldquo;This is the madness of
      jealousy,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;There is only one way to deal with it. If I cry
      out&mdash;if I show that I am afraid&mdash;if I irritate him, it will
      soon, be over.&rdquo; She told herself in a moment that she must try gentleness,
      tenderness, reason, affection, love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling from head to foot, she stepped up to him again, and began softly
      and sweetly trying to explain herself. &ldquo;John, dear John, if you see me
      with certain people and in certain places you must not think from that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he broke in upon her with a torrent of words. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of it at
      all, Glory. When I look ahead I see nothing but shame and misery and
      degradation for you in the future. That man is destroying you body and
      soul. He is leading you on to the devil and hell and damnation, and I can
      not stand by and see it done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, John, you are mistaken, quite mistaken.&rdquo; But, with a look of
      sombre fury, he cried, &ldquo;Can you deny it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can protect and care for myself, John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that man&rsquo;s words in your ears, still can you deny it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she remembered Drake&rsquo;s last whisper as she got into the hansom,
      and she covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t! It is the truth! The man is following you to ruin you, and you
      know it. You&rsquo;ve known it from the first, therefore you deserve all that
      can ever come to you. Do you know what you are guilty of? You are guilty
      of soul-suicide. What is the suicide of the body to the suicide of the
      soul? What is the crime of the poor broken creature who only chooses death
      and the grave before starvation or shame, compared to the sin of the
      wretched woman who murders her soul for sake of the lusts and vanities of
      the world? The law of man may punish, the one, but the vengeance of God is
      waiting for the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was crying behind her hands, and, in spite of the fury into which he
      had lashed himself, a great pity took hold of him. He felt as if
      everything were slipping away from him, and he was trying to stand on an
      avalanche. But he told himself that he would not waver, that he would hold
      to his purpose, that he would stand firm as a rock. Heaving a deep sigh,
      he walked to and fro across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Glory, Glory! Can&rsquo;t you understand what it is to me to be the messenger
      of God&rsquo;s judgment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gasped for breath, and what had been a vague surmise became a
      certainty&mdash;thinking he was God&rsquo;s avenger, yet with nothing but a poor
      spasm of jealousy in his heart, he had come with a fearful purpose to
      perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did what I could in other ways and it was all in vain. Time after time
      I tried to save you from these dangers, but you would not listen. I was
      ready for any change, any sacrifice. Once I would have given up all the
      world for you, Glory&mdash;you know that quite well&mdash;friends,
      kinsmen, country, everything, even my work and my duty, and, but for the
      grace of God, God himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his tenderness broke again into a headlong torrent of reproach. &ldquo;You
      failed me, didn&rsquo;t you? At the last moment, too&mdash;the very last! Not
      content with the suicide of your own soul, you must attempt to murder the
      soul of another. Do you know what that is? That is the unpardonable sin!
      You are crying, aren&rsquo;t you? Why are you crying?&rdquo; But even while he said
      this something told him that all he was waiting for was that her beautiful
      eyes should be raised and their splendid light flash upon him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is all over now. It was a blunder, and the breach between us is
      irreparable. I am better as I am&mdash;far, far better. Without friends or
      kin or country, consecrated for life, cut off from the world, separate,
      alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew that her moment had come, and that she must vanquish this man and
      turn him from his purpose, whatever it was, by the only weapon a woman
      could use&mdash;his love of her. &ldquo;I do not deny that you have a right to
      be angry with me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t think that I have not given up
      something too. At the time you speak of, when I chose this life and
      refused to go with you to the South Seas, I sacrificed a good deal&mdash;I
      sacrificed love. Do you think I didn&rsquo;t realize what that meant? That
      whatever the pleasure and delight my art might bring me, and the flattery,
      and the fame, and the applause, there were joys I was never to know&mdash;the
      happiness that every poor woman may feel, though she isn&rsquo;t clever at all,
      and the world knows nothing about her&mdash;the happiness of being a wife
      and a mother, and of holding her place in life, however humble she is and
      simple and unknown, and of linking the generations each to each. And,
      though the world has been so good to me, do you think I have ever ceased
      to regret that? Do you think I don&rsquo;t remember it sometimes when the house
      rises at me, or when I am coming home, or perhaps when I awake in the
      middle of the night? And notwithstanding all this success with which the
      world has crowned me, do you think I don&rsquo;t hunger sometimes for what
      success can never buy&mdash;the love of a good man who would love me with
      all his soul and his strength and everything that is his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of a dry and husky throat John Storm answered: &ldquo;I would rather die a
      thousand, thousand deaths than touch a hair of your head, Glory.... But
      God&rsquo;s will is his will!&rdquo; he added, quivering and trembling. The compulsion
      of a great passion was drawing him, but he struggled hard against it. &ldquo;And
      then this success&mdash;you cling to it nevertheless!&rdquo; he cried, with a
      forced laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I cling to it,&rdquo; she said, wiping away the tears that had begun to
      fall. &ldquo;I can not give it up, I can not, I can not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is the worth of your repentance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not repentance&mdash;it is what you said it was&mdash;in this room&mdash;long
      ago.... We are of different natures, John&mdash;that is the real trouble
      between us, now and always has been. But whether we like it or not, our
      lives are wrapped up together for all that. We can&rsquo;t do without each
      other. God makes men and women like that sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a piteous smile on his face. &ldquo;I never doubted your feeling for
      me, Glory. No, not even when you hurt me most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if God made us so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forgive myself, Glory, though Heaven itself forgives me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If God makes us love each other in spite of every barrier that divides us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never know another happy hour in this life. Glory&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why should we struggle? It is our fate and we can not conquer it.
      You can&rsquo;t give up your life, John, and I can&rsquo;t give up mine; but our
      hearts are one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sang like music in his ears, and something in his aching heart
      was saying: &ldquo;What are the laws we make for ourselves compared to the laws
      God makes for us?&rdquo; Suddenly he felt something warm. It was Glory&rsquo;s breath
      on his hand. A fragrance like incense seemed to envelop him. He gasped as
      if suffocating, and sat down on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong, dear, if you think I care for the man you speak of. He has
      been very good to me and helped me in my career, but he is nothing to me&mdash;nothing
      whatever&mdash;But we are such old friends, John? It seems impossible to
      remember a time when we were not old chums, you and I! Sometimes I dream
      of those dear old days in the &lsquo;lil oilan&rsquo;! Aw, they were ter&rsquo;ble&mdash;just
      ter&rsquo;ble! Do you remember the boat&mdash;the <i>Gloria</i>&mdash;do you
      remember her?&rdquo; (He clinched his hands as though to hold on to his purpose,
      but it was slipping through his fingers like sand.) &ldquo;What times they were!
      Coming round the castle of a summer evening when the bay and the sky were
      like two sheets of silvered glass looking into each other, and you and I
      singing &lsquo;John Peel&rsquo;&rdquo; (in a quavering voice she sang a bar or two): &ldquo;&lsquo;D&rsquo;ye
      ken John Peel with his coat so gay? D&rsquo;ye ken John Peel&rsquo;&mdash;-Do you
      remember it, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was sobbing and laughing by turns. It was her old self, and the cruel
      years seemed to roll back. But still he struggled. &ldquo;What is the love of
      the body to the love of the soul?&rdquo; he told himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wore flannels then, and I was in a white jersey&mdash;like this,
      see,&rdquo; and she snatched up from the mantelpiece the photograph he had been
      looking at. &ldquo;I got up my first act in imitation of it, and sometimes in
      the middle of a scene&mdash;such a jolly scene, too&mdash;my mind goes
      back to that sweet old time and I burst out crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed the photograph away. &ldquo;Why do you remind me of those days?&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Is it only to make me realize the change in you?&rdquo; But even at that
      moment the wonderful eyes pierced him through and through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I so much changed, John? Am I? No, no, dear! It is only my hair done
      differently. See, see!&rdquo; and with trembling fingers she tore her hair from
      its knot. It fell in clusters over her shoulders and about her face. He
      wanted to lay his hand on it, and he turned to her and then turned away,
      fighting with himself as with an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or is it this old rag of lace that is so unlike my jersey? There&mdash;there!&rdquo;
       she cried, tearing the lace from her neck, and throwing it on the floor
      and trampling upon it. &ldquo;Look at me now, John&mdash;look at me? Am I not
      the same as ever? Why don&rsquo;t you look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was fighting for her life. He started to his feet and came to her with
      his teeth set and his pupils fixed. &ldquo;This is only the devil tempting me.
      Say your prayers, child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grasped her left hand with his right. His grip almost overtaxed her
      strength and she felt faint. In an explosion of emotion the insane frenzy
      for destroying had come upon him again. He longed to give his feelings
      physical expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say them, say them!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;God sent me to kill you, Glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sensation of terror and of triumph came over her at once. She half
      closed her eyes and threw her other arm around his neck. &ldquo;No, but to love
      me!&mdash;Kiss me, John!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a cry came from him like that of a man flinging himself over a
      precipice. He threw his arms about her, and her disordered hair fell over
      his face.

    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was God&rsquo;s voice&mdash;it was the devil&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was creeping like a thief through the streets of London in the
      dark hours before the dawn. It was a peaceful night after the thunderstorm
      of the evening before. A few large stars had come out, a clear moon, was
      shining, and the air was quiet after the cries, the crackling tumult, and
      all the fury of human throats. There was only the swift rattling of mail
      cars running to the Post Office, the heavy clank of country carts crawling
      to Covent Garden, the measured tread of policemen, and the muddled
      laughter of drunken men and women by the coffee stands at the street
      corners. &ldquo;&lsquo;Ow&rsquo;s the deluge, myte? Not come off yet? Well, give us a cup of
      cawfee on the strength of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if eyes looked down on him from the dark sky and pierced him
      through and through. His whole life had been an imposture from the first&mdash;his
      quarrel with his father, his taking Orders, his entering the monastery and
      his leaving it, his crusade in Soho, his intention of following Father
      Damien, his predictions at Westminster&mdash;all, all had been false, and
      the expression of a lie! He was a sham, a mockery, a whited sepulchre, and
      had grossly sinned against the light and against God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the spiritual disillusion had come at last, and it had revealed him to
      himself at an awful depth of self-deception. Thinking in his pride and
      arrogance he was the divine messenger, the avenger, the man of God, he had
      set out to shed blood like any wretched criminal, any jealous murderer who
      was driven along by devilish passion. How the devil had played with him
      too!&mdash;with him, who was dedicated by the most solemn and sacred vows!
      And he had been as stubble before the wind&mdash;as chaff that the storm
      carrieth away!
    </p>
    <p>
      With such feelings of poignant anguish he plodded through the echoing
      streets. Mechanically he made his way back to Westminster. By the time he
      got there the moon and stars had gone and the chill of daybreak was in the
      air. He saw and heard nothing, but as he crossed Broad Sanctuary a line of
      mounted police trotted past him with their swords clanking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not yet daylight when he knocked at the door of his chambers under
      the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; came in a fierce whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; he said in a spiritless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, and Brother Andrew, with the affectionate whine of a
      dog who has been snarling at his master in the dark, said: &ldquo;Oh, is it you,
      Father? I thought you were gone. Did you meet them? They&rsquo;ve been searching
      for you everywhere all night long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still spoke in whispers, as if some one had been ill. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t light
      up. They&rsquo;d be sure to see and perhaps come back. They&rsquo;ll come in the
      morning in any case. Oh, it&rsquo;s terrible! Worse than ever now! Haven&rsquo;t you
      heard what has happened? Somebody has been killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was struggling to listen, but everything seemed to be happening a
      long way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not killed exactly, but badly hurt, and taken to the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Charlie Wilkes. He had insulted the name of the Father, and
      Pincher, the pawnbroker, had knocked him down. His head had struck against
      the curb, and he had been picked up insensible. Then the police had come
      and Pincher had been taken off to the police station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s my mother I&rsquo;m thinking of,&rdquo; said Brother Andrew, and he brushed
      his sleeve across his eyes. &ldquo;You must get away at once, Father. They&rsquo;ll
      lay everything on you. What&rsquo;s to be done? Let me think! Let me think! How
      my head is going round and round! There&rsquo;s a train from Euston to the north
      at five in the morning, isn&rsquo;t there? You must catch that. Don&rsquo;t speak,
      Father! Don&rsquo;t say you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said John with a look of utter dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change that had come over him since the night before startled the lay
      brother. &ldquo;But I suppose you&rsquo;ve been out all night. How tired you look! Can
      I get you anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John did not answer, and the lay brother brought some brown bread and
      coaxed him to eat a little of it. The day was beginning to dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you must go, Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can take care of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to the Brotherhood; take the dog with you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dog!&rdquo; Brother Andrew seemed to be about to say something; but he
      checked himself, and with a wild look he muttered: &ldquo;Oh, I know what <i>I&rsquo;ll</i>
      do. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; said John, and then the broken man was back in the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      His nervous system had been exhausted by the events of the night, and when
      he entered the railway station he could scarcely put one foot before
      another. &ldquo;Looks as if <i>he&rsquo;d</i> had enough,&rdquo; said somebody behind him.
      He found an empty carriage and took his seat in the corner. A kind of
      stupor had come over his faculties and he could neither think nor feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four young men and boys were sorting and folding newspapers at a
      counter that stood on trestles before the closed-up bookstall. A placard
      slipped from the fingers of one of them and fell on to the floor. John saw
      his own name in monster letters, and he began to ask himself what he was
      doing. Was he running away? It was cowardly, it was contemptible! And then
      it was so useless! He might go to the ends of the earth, yet he could not
      escape the only enemy it was worth while to fly from. That enemy was
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he remembered that he had not taken his ticket, and he got out of
      the train. But instead of going to the ticket office he stood aside and
      tried to think what he ought to do. Then there was confusion and noise,
      people were hurrying past him, somebody was calling to him, and finally
      the engine whistled and the smoke rose to the roof. When he came to
      himself the train was gone and he was standing on the platform alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo; he asked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely summer morning and the streets were empty and quiet.
      Little by little they became populous and noisy, and at length he was
      walking in a crowd. It was nine o&rsquo;clock by this time, and he was in the
      Whitechapel road, going along with a motley troop of Jews, Polish Jews,
      Germans, German Jews, and all the many tribes of Cockneydom. Two costers
      behind him were talking and laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor&rsquo; blesh you, it&rsquo;s jest abart enneff to myke a corpse laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it? An acquyntince uv mine&mdash;d&rsquo;ye know Jow &lsquo;Awkins? Him as kep&rsquo; 
      the frahd fish shop off of Flower and Dean. Yus? Well, he sold his bit uv
      biziness lahst week for a song, thinkin&rsquo; the world was acomin&rsquo; to a end,
      and this mornin&rsquo; I meets &lsquo;im on the &lsquo;Owben Viadeck lookin&rsquo; as if &lsquo;e&rsquo;d &lsquo;ad
      the smallpox or semthink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm had scarcely heard them. He had a strange feeling that
      everything was happening hundreds of miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; he asked himself again. Between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock
      he was back in the city, walking aimlessly on and on. He did not choose
      the unfrequented thoroughfares, and when people looked into his face he
      thought, &ldquo;If anybody asks me who I am I&rsquo;ll tell him.&rdquo; It was eight hours
      since he had eaten anything, and he felt weak and faint. Coming upon a
      coffee-house, he went in and ordered food. The place was full of young
      clerks at their midday meal. Most of them were reading newspapers which
      they had folded and propped up on the tables before them, but two who sat
      near were talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These predictions of the end of the world are a mania, a monomania, which
      recurs at regular intervals of the world&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; said one. He was a
      little man with a turned-up nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the strange thing is that people go on believing them,&rdquo; said his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not strange at all. This big, idiotic, amphorous London has no
      sense of humour. See how industriously it has been engaged for the last
      month in the noble art of making a fool of itself!&rdquo; And then he looked
      around at John Storm, as if proud of his tall language.
    </p>
    <p>
      John did not listen. He knew that everybody was talking about him, yet the
      matter did not seem to concern him now, but to belong to some other
      existence which his soul had had.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length an idea came to him and he thought he knew what he ought to do.
      He ought to go to the Brotherhood and ask to be taken back. But not as a
      son this time, only as a servant, to scour and scrub to the end of his
      life. There used to be a man to sweep out the church and ring the church
      bell&mdash;he might be allowed to do menial work like that. He had proved
      false to his ideal, he had not been able to resist the lures of earthly
      love, but God was merciful. He would not utterly reject him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His self-abasement was abject, yet several hours had passed before he
      attempted to carry out this design. It was the time of Evensong when he
      reached the church, and the brothers were singing their last hymn:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Jesus, lover of my soul,
    Let me to thy bosom fly.
</pre>
    <p>
      He stood by the porch and listened. The street was very quiet; hardly
      anybody was passing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Hide me, O my Saviour hide,
    Till the storms of life be past.
</pre>
    <p>
      His heart surged up to his throat, and he could scarcely bear the pain of
      it. Yes, yes, yes! Other refuge had he none!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a new thought smote him, and he felt like a man roused from a
      deep sleep. Glory! He had been thinking only of his own soul and his
      soul&rsquo;s salvation, and had forgotten his duty to others. He had his duty to
      Glory above all others and lie could not and must not escape from it. He
      must take his place by her side, and if that included the abandonment of
      his ideals, so be it! He had been proved unworthy of a life of holiness;
      he must lower his flag, he must be content to live the life of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not think what he ought to do next, and when night fell he
      was still wandering aimlessly through the streets. He had turned eastward
      again, and even in the tumultuous thoroughfares of the Mile End he could
      not help seeing that something unusual was going on. People in drink were
      rolling about the streets, and shouting and singing as if it had been a
      public holiday. &ldquo;Glad you ain&rsquo;t in kingdom-come to-night, old gal!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,
      what do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At twelve o&rsquo;clock he went into a lodging-house and asked if he could have
      a bed. The keeper was in the kitchen talking with two men who were cooking
      a herring for their supper, and he looked up at his visitor in
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I sleep you, sir? We ain&rsquo;t got no accommodation for gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and then he stopped, looked more attentively, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you from the Settlement, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm made some inarticulate reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thort ye might be, sir. We often &lsquo;as &lsquo;em &lsquo;ere sempling the cawfee, but
      blessed if they ever wanted to semple a bed afore. Still, if <i>you</i>
      down&rsquo;t mind&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be better than I deserve, my man. Can you give me a cup of coffee
      before I turn in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, sir! Set down, sir! Myke yourself at &lsquo;ome. Me and my
      friends were just talkin&rsquo; of a gentleman of your cloth, sir&mdash;the pore
      feller as &lsquo;as got into trouble acrost Westminster way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were talking of him, were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sem &lsquo;ere says the biziness pize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>must</i> py, or people wouldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said the man leaning over
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down&rsquo;t you believe it. That little gime down&rsquo;t py. Cause why? Look at the
      bloomin&rsquo; stoo the feller&rsquo;s in now. If they ketch &lsquo;im &lsquo;e&rsquo;ll get six months
      &lsquo;ard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s &lsquo;e been doin&rsquo; it for? I down&rsquo;t see nothink in it if it down&rsquo;t
      py.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cause he believes in it, thet&rsquo;s why!&mdash;What do you think, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the man has come by a just fall,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;God will never use
      him again, having brought him to shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must hev been a wrong un certingly,&rdquo; said the man over the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Storm awoke in his cubicle next morning he saw his way clearer.
      He would deliver himself up to the warrant that was issued for his arrest,
      and go through with it to the end. Then he would return to Glory a free
      man, and God would find work for him even yet, after this awful lesson to
      his presumption and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That feller as was took ter the awspital is dead,&rdquo; said somebody in the
      kitchen, and then there was the crinkling of a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is &lsquo;e?&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;The best thing the Father can do is to &lsquo;ook it
      then. Cause why? Whether &lsquo;e done it or not they&rsquo;ll fix it on ter &lsquo;im,
      doncher know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s head spun round and round. He remembered what Brother Andrew had
      said of Charlie Wilkes, and his heart, so warm a moment ago, felt benumbed
      as by frost. Nevertheless, at nine o&rsquo;clock he was going westward in the
      Underground. People looked at him when he stepped into the carriage. He
      thought everybody knew him, and that the world was only playing with him
      as a cat plays with a mouse. The compartment was full of young clerks
      smoking pipes and reading newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most extraordinary!&rdquo; said one of them. &ldquo;The fellow has disappeared as
      absolutely as if he had been carried up into a cloud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why extraordinary?&rdquo; said another in a thin voice. This one was not
      smoking, and he had the startled eyes of the enthusiast. &ldquo;Elijah was taken
      up to heaven in the body, wasn&rsquo;t he? And why not Father Storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the first, taking his pipe out of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people believe that,&rdquo; said the thin voice timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you want a dose of medicine, you do,&rdquo; said the first speaker, shaking
      out his ash and looking round with a knowing air. The young men got out in
      the City; John went on to Westminster Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was terrible. Why could he not take advantage of the popular
      superstition and disappear indeed, taking Glory with him! But no, no, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all the torment of his soul his religion had remained the same,
      and now it rose up before him like a pillar of cloud and fire. He would do
      as he had intended, whatever the consequences, and if he was charged with
      crimes he had not committed, if he was accused of the offences of his
      followers, he would make no defence; if need be he would allow himself to
      be convicted, and being innocent in this instance God would accept his
      punishment as an atonement for his other sins! Glorious sacrifice! He
      would make it! He would make it! And Glory herself would be proud of it
      some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the glow of this resolution upon him he turned into Scotland Yard and
      stepped boldly up to the office. The officer in charge received him with a
      deferential bow, but went on talking in a low voice to an inspector of
      police who was also standing at the other side of a counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange?&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;I thought he was seen getting into the train at
      Euston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know that he wasn&rsquo;t either, in spite of all he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking of the dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the dog, too,&rdquo; said the inspector, and then seeing John, &ldquo;Hello!
      Who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer stepped up to the counter. &ldquo;What can I do for you, sir?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      John knew that the supreme moment had come, and he felt proud of himself
      that his resolution did not waver. Lifting his head, he said in a low and
      rapid voice, &ldquo;I understand that you have a warrant for the arrest of
      Father Storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We <i>had</i>, sir,&rdquo; the officer answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked embarrassed. &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that Father Storm is now in custody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John stared at the man with a feeling of stupefaction. &ldquo;In custody! Did
      you say in custody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely! He has just given himself up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John answered impetuously, &ldquo;But that is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why impossible, sir? Are you interested in this case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A certain quivering moved John&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;I am Father Storm himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer was silent for a moment. Then he turned to the inspector with
      a pitying smile. &ldquo;Another of them,&rdquo; he said significantly. The psychology
      of criminals had been an interesting study to this official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said the inspector, and he went hurriedly through an
      inner doorway. The officer asked John some questions about his movements
      since yesterday. John answered vaguely in broken and rather bewildering
      sentences. Then the inspector returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Father Storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know of anybody who might wish to personate you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid that any one should do that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, there is some one here who says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way quietly,&rdquo; said the inspector, and John followed him to the
      inner room. His pride was all gone, his head was hanging low, and he was a
      prey to extraordinary agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man in a black cassock was sitting at a table making a statement to
      another officer with an open book before him. His back was to the door,
      but John knew him in a moment. It was Brother Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why have you given yourself up?&rdquo; the officer asked, and Brother
      Andrew began a rambling and foolish explanation. He had seen it stated in
      an evening paper that the Father had been traced to the train at Euston,
      and he thought it a pity&mdash;a pity that the police&mdash;that the
      police should waste their time&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;You are in a position that should make you
      careful of what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the inspector stepped forward, leaving John by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still say you are Father Storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; said Brother Andrew indignantly. &ldquo;If I was anybody else,
      do you think I should come here and give myself up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who is this standing behind you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother Andrew turned and saw John with a start of surprise and a cry of
      terror. He seemed hardly able to believe in the reality of what was before
      him, and his restless eyeballs rolled fearfully. John tried to speak, but
      he could only utter a few inarticulate sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the inspector. And while John stood with head down and
      heaving breast, Brother Andrew began to laugh hysterically and to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who this is? This is my lay brother! I brought him out of
      the Brotherhood six months ago, and he has been with me ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officers looked at each other. &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Brother Andrew in
      an imperious voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you believe me? You mustn&rsquo;t touch this man. He
      has done nothing&mdash;nothing at all. He is as tender as a woman and
      wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly. What&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officers also were dropping their heads, and the heartrending voice
      went on: &ldquo;Have you arrested him? You&rsquo;ll do very wrong if you arrest&mdash;&mdash;But
      perhaps he has given himself up! That would be just like him. He is
      devoted to me and would tell you any falsehood if he thought it would&mdash;&mdash;But
      you must send him away. Tell him to go back to his old mother&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the proper place for him. Good God! do you think I&rsquo;m telling you lies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment. &ldquo;My poor lad, hush, hush!&rdquo; said John in a
      tone full of tenderness and authority. Then he turned to the inspector
      with a pitiful smile of triumph. &ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite satisfied, Father,&rdquo; the officer answered in a broken voice, and
      then Brother Andrew began to cry.

      When Glory awoke on the morning after the Derby and thought of John she
      felt no remorse. A sea of bewildering difficulty lay somewhere ahead, but
      she would not look at it. He loved her, she loved him, and nothing else
      mattered. If rules and vows stood between them, so much the worse for such
      enemies of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious that a subtle change had come over her. She was not
      herself any longer, but somebody else as well; not a woman merely, but in
      some sort a man; not Glory only, but also John Storm. Oh, delicious
      mystery! Oh, joy of joys! His arms seemed to be about her waist still, and
      his breath to linger about her neck. With a certain tremor, a certain
      thrill, she reached for a hand-glass and looked at herself to learn if
      there was any difference in her face that the rest of the world would see.
      Yes, her eyes had another lustre, a deeper light, but she lay back in the
      cool bed with a smile and a long-drawn sigh. What matter whatever
      happened! Gone were the six cruel months in which she had awakened every
      morning with a pain at her breast. She was happy, happy, happy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning sun was streaming across the room when Liza came in with the
      tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye see the Farver last night, Miss Gloria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; that was all right, Liza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day&rsquo;s newspaper was lying folded on the tray. She took it up and
      opened it, remembering the Derby, and thinking for the first time of
      Drake&rsquo;s triumph. But what caught her eye in glaring head-lines was a
      different matter: &ldquo;The Panic Terror&mdash;Collapse of the Farce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a shriek of triumphant derision. The fateful day had come and gone,
      yet London stood where it did before. Last night&rsquo;s tide had flowed and
      ebbed, and the dwellings of men were not submerged. No earthquake had
      swallowed up St. Paul&rsquo;s; no mighty bonfire of the greatest city of the
      world had lit up the sky of Europe, and even the thunderstorm which had
      broken over London had only laid the dust and left the air more clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London is to be congratulated on the collapse of this panic, which, so
      far as we can hear, has been attended by only one casualty&mdash;an
      assault in Brown&rsquo;s Square, Westminster, on a young soldier, Charles
      Wilkes, of the Wellington Barracks, by two of the frantic army of the
      terror-stricken. The injured man was removed to St. Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital,
      while his assailants were taken to Rochester Row police station, and we
      have only to regret that the clerical panic-maker himself has not yet
      shared the fate of his followers. Late last night the authorities,
      recovering from their extraordinary supineness, issued a warrant for his
      arrest, but up to the time of going to press he had escaped the vigilance
      of the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory was breathing audibly as she read, and Liza, who was drawing up the
      blind, looked back at her with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liza, have you mentioned to anybody that Father Storm was here last
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, miss, there ain&rsquo;t nobody stirring yet, and besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t mention it to a soul. Will you do me that great, great
      kindness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down&rsquo;t ye know I will, mum?&rdquo; said Liza, with a twinkle of the eye and a
      wag of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory dressed hurriedly, went down to the drawing-room, and wrote a
      letter. It was to Sefton, the manager. &ldquo;Do not expect me to play to-night.
      I don&rsquo;t feel up to it. Sorry to be so troublesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Rosa came in with another newspaper in her hand, and, without saying
      anything, Glory showed her the letter. Rosa read it and returned it in
      silence. They understood each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next few hours Glory&rsquo;s impatience became feverish, and as soon
      as the first of the evening papers appeared she sent out for it. The panic
      was subsiding, and the people who had gone to the outskirts were returning
      to the city in troops, looking downcast and ashamed. No news of Father
      Storm. Inquiry that morning at Scotland Yard elicited the fact that
      nothing had yet been heard of him. There was much perplexity as to where
      he had spent the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s face tingled and burned. From hour to hour she sent out for new
      editions. The panic itself was now eclipsed by the interest of John
      Storm&rsquo;s disappearance. His followers scouted the idea that he had fled
      from London. Nevertheless, he had fallen. As a pretender to the gift of
      prophecy his career was at an end, and his crazy system of mystical
      divinity was the laughing-stock of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not surprise us that this second Moses, this mock Messiah, has
      broken down. Such men always do, and must collapse, but that the public
      should ever have taken seriously a movement which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then
      a grotesque list of John&rsquo;s followers&mdash;one pawnbroker, one waiter, one
      &ldquo;knocker-up,&rdquo; two or three apprentices, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she read all this, Glory was at the same time glowing with shame,
      trembling with fear, and burning with indignation. She dined with Rosa
      alone, and they tried to talk of other matters. The effort was useless. At
      last Rosa said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to follow this thing up for the paper, dear, and I&rsquo;m going
      to-night to see if they hold the usual service in his church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I go with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish to, but it will be useless&mdash;he won&rsquo;t be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prime Minister left London last night&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help thinking
      there is something in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be there, Rosa. He&rsquo;s not the man to run away. I know him,&rdquo; said
      Glory proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was crowded, and it was with difficulty they found seats.
      John&rsquo;s enemies were present in force&mdash;all the owners of vested
      interests who had seen their livelihood threatened by the man who declared
      war on vice and its upholders. There was a dangerous atmosphere before the
      service began, and, notwithstanding her brave faith in him, Glory found
      herself praying that John Storm might not come. As the organ played and
      the choir and clergy entered the excitement was intense, and some of the
      congregation got on to their seats in their eagerness to see if the Father
      was there. He was not there. The black cassock and biretta in which he had
      lately preached were nowhere to be seen, and a murmur of disappointment
      passed over friends and enemies alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a disgraceful spectacle. A man with a bloated face and a bandage
      about his forehead rose in his place and cried, &ldquo;No popery, boys!&rdquo;
       Straightaway the service, which was being conducted by two of the clerical
      brothers from the Brotherhood, was interrupted by hissing, whistling,
      shouting, yelling, and whooping indescribable. Songs were roared out
      during the lessons, and cushions, cassocks, and prayer-books were flung at
      the altar and its furniture. The terrified choir boys fled downstairs to
      their own quarters, and the clergy were driven out of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s own people stole away in terror and shame, but Glory leaped to her
      feet as if to fling herself on the cowardly rabble. Her voice was lost in
      the tumult, and Rosa drew her out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no law in the land to prevent brawling like this?&rdquo; she cried,
      but the police paid no heed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the congregation, which had broken up, came rushing out of the church
      and round to the door leading to the chambers beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found him,&rdquo; thought Glory, pressing her hand over her heart. But
      no, it was another matter. Immediately afterward there rose over the babel
      of human voices the deep music of the bloodhound in full cry. The crowd
      shrieked with fear and delight, then surged and parted, and the dog came
      running through with its stern up, its head down, its forehead wrinkled,
      and the long drapery of its ears and flews hanging in folds about its
      face. In a moment it was gone, its mellow note was dying away in the
      neighbouring streets, and a gang of ruffians were racing after it.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll find the feller if he&rsquo;s in London!&rdquo; somebody shouted; it was the
      man with the bandaged forehead&mdash;and there were yells of fiendish
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s head was going round, and she was holding on to Rosa&rsquo;s arm with a
      convulsive grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cowards!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;To use that poor creature&rsquo;s devotion to its
      master for their own inhuman ends&mdash;it&rsquo;s cowardly, it&rsquo;s brutal, it&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
      oh, oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, dear,&rdquo; said Rosa, and she dragged Glory away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went back through Broad Sanctuary. Neither spoke, but both were
      thinking: &ldquo;He has gone to the monastery. He intends to stay there until
      the storm is over.&rdquo; At Westminster Bridge they parted. &ldquo;I have somewhere
      to go,&rdquo; said Rosa, turning down to the Underground. &ldquo;She is going to
      Bishopsgate Street,&rdquo; thought Glory, and they separated with constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to Clement&rsquo;s Inn, Glory found a letter from Drake:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Glory: How can I apologize to you for nay detestable behaviour of
      last night? The memory of what passed has taken all the joy out of the
      success upon which everybody is congratulating me. I have tried to
      persuade myself that you would make allowances for the day and the
      circumstances and my natural excitement. But your life has been so
      blameless that it fills me with anguish and horror to think how I exposed
      you to misrepresentation by allowing you to go to that place, and by
      behaving to you as I did when you were there. Thank God, things went no
      farther, and some blessed power prevented me from carrying out my threat
      to follow you. Believe me, you shall see no more of men like Lord Robert
      Ure and women like his associates. I despise them from my heart, and
      wonder how I can have tolerated them so long. Do let me beg the favour of
      a line consenting to allow me to call and ask your forgiveness. Yours most
      humbly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F. H. N. Drake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory slept badly that night, and as soon as Liza was stirring she rang
      for the newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ye &lsquo;ear the dorg, mum?&rdquo; said Liza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Farver&rsquo;s dorg. It was scratching at the front dawer afore I was up
      this morning. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the milk,&rsquo; sez I. But the minute I opened the dawer up
      it came ter the drawerin&rsquo; room and went snuffling rahnd everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gorn, mum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did anybody else see it? No? You say no? You&rsquo;re sure? Then say nothing
      about it, Liza&mdash;nothing whatever&mdash;that&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper was full of the mysterious disappearance. Not a trace of the
      Father had yet been found. The idea had been started that he had gone into
      seclusion at the Anglican monastery with which he was associated, but on
      inquiry at Bishopsgate Street it was found that nothing had been seen of
      him there. Since yesterday the whole of London had been scoured by the
      police, but not one fact had been brought to light to make clearer the
      mystery of his going away. With the most noticeable face and habit in
      London he had evaded scrutiny and gone into a retirement which baffled
      discovery. No master of the stage art could have devised a more
      sensational disappearance. He had vanished as though whirled to heaven in
      a cloud, and that was literally what the more fanatical of his followers
      believed to have been his fate. Among these persons there were wild-eyed
      hangers-on telling of a flight upward on a fiery chariot, as well as a
      predicted disappearance and reappearance after three days. Such were the
      stories being gulped down by the thousands who still clung with an
      indefinable fascination to the memory of the charlatan. Meantime the
      soldier Wilkes had died of his injuries, and the coroner&rsquo;s inquiry was to
      be opened that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfeeling brutes! The bloodhound is an angel of mercy compared to them,&rdquo;
       thought Glory, but the worst sting was in the thought that John had fled
      out of fear and was now in hiding somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward noon the newsboys were rushing through the Inn, crying their papers
      against all regulations, and at the same moment Rosa came in to say that
      John Storm had surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; cried Glory; &ldquo;I knew he would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Rosa told her of Brother Andrew&rsquo;s attempt to personate his master,
      and with what pitiful circumstances it had ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a lay brother, you say, Rosa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a poor half-witted soul apparently&mdash;must have been, to imagine
      that a subterfuge like that would succeed in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s eyes were gleaming. &ldquo;Rosa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I would rather have done
      what he did than play the greatest part in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wished to be present at the trial, and proposed to Rosa that she
      should go with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But dare you, my child? Considering your old friendship, dare you see him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare I?&rdquo; said Glory. &ldquo;Dare I stand in the dock by his side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when she got to Bow Street and saw the crowds in the court, the line
      of distinguished persons of both sexes allowed to sit on the bench, the
      army of reporters and newspaper artists, and all the mass of smiling and
      eager faces, without ruth or pity, gathered together as for a show, her
      heart sickened and she crept out of the place before the prisoner was
      brought into the dock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking to and fro in the corridor, she waited the result of the trial. It
      was not a long one. The charge was that of causing people unlawfully to
      assemble to the danger of the public peace. There was no defence. A man
      with a bandaged forehead was the first of the witnesses. He was a
      publican, who lived in Brown&rsquo;s Square and had been a friend of the soldier
      Wilkes. The injury to his forehead was the result of a blow from a stick
      given by the prisoner&rsquo;s lay brother on the night of the Derby, when, with
      the help of the deceased, he had attempted to liberate the bloodhound. He
      had much to say of the Father&rsquo;s sermons, his speeches, his predictions,
      his slanders, and his disloyalty. Other witnesses were Pincher and
      Hawkins. They were in a state of abject fear at the fate hanging over
      their own heads, and tried to save their own skins by laying the blame of
      their own conduct upon the Father. The last witness was Brother Andrew,
      and he broke down utterly. Within an hour Rosa came out to say that John
      Storm had been committed for trial. Bail was not asked for, and the
      prisoner, who had not uttered a word from first to last, had been taken
      back to the cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory hurried home and shut herself in her room. The newsboys in the
      street were shouting, &ldquo;Father Storm in the dock!&rdquo; and filling the air with
      their cries. She covered her ears with her hands, and made noises in her
      throat that she might not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s career was at an end. It was all her fault. If she had
      yielded to his desire to leave London, or if she had joined him there, how
      different everything must have been! But she had broken in upon his life
      and wrecked it. She had sinned against him who had given her everything
      that one human soul can give another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liza came up with, red eyes, bringing the evening papers and a letter. The
      papers contained long reports of the trial and short editorials reproving
      the public for its interest in such a poor impostor. Some of them
      contained sketches of the prisoner and of the distinguished persons
      recognised in court. &ldquo;The stage was represented by&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; and
      then a caricature of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was from Aunt Rachel:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear, My Best-Beloved Glory: I know how much your kind <i>heart</i>
      will be lowered by the painful tidings I have to write to you. Lord Storm
      died on Monday and was buried to-day. To the last he declared he would
      never consent to make peace with John, and he has left nothing to him but
      his title, so that our dear friend is now a nobleman without an estate.
      Everybody about the old lord at the end was unanimous in favour of his
      son, but he would not listen to them, and the scene at the deathbed was
      shocking. It seems that with his dying breath and many bursts of laughter
      he read aloud his will, which ordered that his effects should be sold and
      the proceeds given to some society for the protection of the Established
      Church. And then he told old Chaise that as soon as he was gone a coffin
      was to be got and he was to be screwed down at once, &lsquo;for,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;my
      son would not come to see me <i>living</i>, and he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stand grinning
      at me <i>dead</i>.&rsquo; The funeral was at Kirkpatrick this morning, and <i>few</i>
      came to see the last of one who had left none to mourn him; but just as
      the remains were being deposited in the dark vault a carriage drove up and
      an elderly gentleman got out. No one knew him, and he stood and looked
      down with his impassive face while the service was being read, and then,
      without speaking to any one, he got back into the carriage and drove away.
      The <i>minute</i> he was gone I told Anna he was somebody of consequence;
      and then everybody said it must be Lord Storm&rsquo;s brother and no less a
      person than the Prime Minister of England. It seems that the sale is to
      come off immediately, so that Knockaloe will be a waste, as if sown with
      salt; and, so far as this island is concerned, all trace of the Storms,
      father and son, will be gone for good. I ever knew it must end thus! But I
      will more particularly tell you everything when we meet again, which I
      hope may be <i>soon</i>. Meantime I need not say how much I am, my dear
      child, your ever fond&mdash;nay, more than fond&mdash;<i>devoted</i>
      auntie.

    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rosa, across the dinner table, &ldquo;the sudden fall of a man who
      has filled a large space in the public eye is always pitiful. It is like
      the fall of a great tree in the forest. One never realized how big it was
      until it was down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful! awful!&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether one liked the man or not, such a downfall seems hard to reconcile
      with the idea of a beneficent Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard? Impossible, you mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m only a pagan, and always have been; but I can&rsquo;t believe in a God
      that does nothing&mdash;I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, we can&rsquo;t see the end yet. After the cross the resurrection, as the
      Church folks say; and who knows but out of all this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to become of his church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;ll be people enough to see to that, and if the dear Archdeacon&mdash;but
      he&rsquo;s busy with Mrs. Macrae, bless him! She has gone to wreck at last, and
      is living hidden away in a farmhouse somewhere, that she may drink herself
      to death without detection and interruption. But the Archdeacon and Lord
      Robert have found her out, and there they are hovering round like two
      vultures, waiting for the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his orphanage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s another pair of shoes altogether, dear. Being an institution
      that asks for an income instead of giving one, there&rsquo;ll be nobody too keen
      to take it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! O God! What a world it is!&rdquo; cried Glory.

      After dinner she went off to Westminster in search of the orphanage. It
      stood on a corner of the church square. The door was closed, and the
      windows of the ground floor were shuttered. With difficulty she obtained
      admission and access to the person in charge. This was an elderly lady in
      a black silk dress and with snow-white hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no the matron, miss,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The matron&rsquo;s gone&mdash;fled awa&rsquo; 
      like a&rsquo; the lave o&rsquo; the grand Sisters, thinking sure the mob would mak&rsquo; 
      this house their next point of attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I know whom <i>you</i> are&mdash;you&rsquo;re Mrs. Callender,&rdquo; said Glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane Callender I am, young leddy. And who may ye be yersel&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a friend of John&rsquo;s, and I want to know if there&rsquo;s anything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no the lassie hersel&rsquo;, are ye? You are, though; I see fine you
      are! Come, kiss me&mdash;again, lassie! Oh, dear! oh, dear! And to think
      we must be meeting same as this! For a&rsquo; the world it&rsquo;s like clasping hands
      ower the puir laddie&rsquo;s grave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They cried in each other&rsquo;s arms, and then both felt better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the children,&rdquo; said Glory, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s looking after them if the matron
      and Sisters are gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just me and the puir bairns theirsel&rsquo;s, and the wee maid of all wark that
      opened the door til ye. But come your ways and look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dormitory was in an upper story. Mrs. Gallender had opened the door
      softly, and Glory stepped into a large dark room in which fifty children
      lay asleep. Their breathing was all that could be heard, and it seemed to
      fill the air as with the rustle of a gentle breeze. But it was hard to
      look upon them and to think of their only earthly father in his cell. With
      full hearts and dry throats the two women returned to a room below.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the square, which before had only shown people standing in
      doorways and lounging at street corners, was crowded with a noisy rabble.
      They were shouting out indecent jokes about &ldquo;monks,&rdquo; &ldquo;his reverend
      lordship,&rdquo; and &ldquo;doctors of diwinity&rdquo;; and a small gang of them had got a
      rope which they were trying to throw as a lasso round a figure of the
      Virgin in a niche over the porch. The figure came down at length amid
      shrieks of delight, and when the police charged the mob they flung stones
      which broke the church windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Glory felt an impulse to throw herself on the cowardly rabble, but
      she only crouched at the window by the side of Mrs. Callender, and looked
      down at the sea of faces below with their evil eyes and cruel mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a thing it is to be a woman!&rdquo; she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, lassie, aye, there&rsquo;s mair than one of us has felt that,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Callender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory did not speak again as long as they knelt by the window, holding
      each other&rsquo;s hands, but the tears that had sprung to her eyes at the
      thought of her helplessness dried up of themselves, and in their place
      came the light of a great resolution. She knew that her hour had struck at
      last&mdash;that this was the beginning of the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatres were emptying and carriages were rolling away from them as
      she drove home by way of the Strand. She saw her name on omnibuses and her
      picture on boardings, and felt a sharp pang. But she was in a state of
      feverish excitement and the pain was gone in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another letter from Drake was waiting for her at the Inn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel, my dear Glory, that you are entirely justified in your silence,
      but to show you how deep is my regret, I am about to put it in my power to
      atone, as far as I can, for the conduct which has quite properly troubled
      and hurt you. You will put me under an eternal obligation to you if you
      will consent to become my wife. We should be friends as well as lovers,
      Glory, and in an age distinguished for brilliant and beautiful women, it
      would be the crown of my honour that my wife was above all a woman of
      genius. Nothing should disturb the development of your gifts, and if any
      social claims conflicted with them, they, and not you, would suffer. For
      the rest I can bring you nothing, dear, but&mdash;thanks to the good
      father who was born before me&mdash;such advantages as belong to wealth.
      But so far as these go there is no pleasure you need deny yourself, and if
      your sympathies are set on any good work for humanity there is no
      opportunity you may not command. With this I can only offer you the love
      and devotion of my whole heart and soul, which now wait in fear and pain
      for your reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory read this letter with a certain quivering of the eyelids, but she
      put it away without a qualm. Nevertheless, the letter was hard to reply
      to, and she made many attempts without satisfying herself in the end.
      There was a note of falsehood in all of them, and she felt troubled and
      ashamed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I remember how good you have been to me from the first, I could cry
      to think of the answer I must give you. But I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;oh, I
      can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t think me ungrateful, and don&rsquo;t suppose I am angry or
      in any way hurt or offended, but to do what you desire is impossible&mdash;quite,
      quite impossible. Oh, if you only knew what it is to deny myself the
      future you offer me, to turn my back on the gladness with which life has
      come to me, to strip all these roses from my hair, you would believe it
      must be a far, far higher call than to worldly rank and greatness that I
      am listening to at last. And it is. A woman may trifle with her heart,
      while the one she loves is well and happy or great and prosperous, but
      when he is down and the cruel world is trampling on him, there can be no
      paltering with it any longer&mdash;-Yes, I must go to <i>him</i> if I go
      to anybody. Besides, you can do without me and he can not. You have all
      the world, and he has nothing but me. If you were a woman you would
      understand all this, but you are loyal and brave and true, and when I look
      at your letter and remember how often you have spoken up for a fallen man
      my heart quivers and my eyes grow dim, and I know what it means to be an
      English gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After writing this letter she went up to her bedroom and busied herself
      about for an hour, making up parcels of her clothing and jewellery, and
      labelling them with envelopes bearing names. The plainer costumes she
      addressed to Aunt Anna, a fur-lined coat to Aunt Rachel, an opera cloak to
      Rosa, and a quantity of underclothing to Liza. All her jewels, and nearly
      all the silver trinkets from the dressing-table, were made up in a parcel
      by themselves and addressed back to the giver&mdash;Sir Francis Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock of St. Clement&rsquo;s Danes was chiming midnight when this was done,
      and she stood a moment and asked herself, &ldquo;Is there anything else?&rdquo; Then
      there was a slippered foot on the stair, and somebody knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me, miss, and can I do anythink for ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory opened the door and found Liza there, half dressed and looking as if
      she had been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Liza, nothing, thank you! But why aren&rsquo;t you in bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep a blessed wink to-night somehow, miss,&rdquo; said Liza. And
      then, looking into the room, &ldquo;But are ye goin&rsquo; away somewhere. Miss
      Gloria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thort ye was&mdash;I could hear ye downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not far, though&mdash;just a little journey&mdash;go back to bed now.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, miss,&rdquo; and Liza went down with lingering footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour or so afterward Glory heard Rosa come in from the office and
      pass up to her bedroom on the floor above. &ldquo;Dear, unselfish soul!&rdquo; she
      thought, and then she sat down to write another letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling Rosa: I am going to leave you, but there is no help for it&mdash;I
      must. Don&rsquo;t you remember I used to say if I should ever find a man who was
      willing to sacrifice all the world for me I would leave everything and
      follow him? I have found him, dear, and he has not only sacrificed all the
      world for my sake, but trampled on Heaven itself. I can&rsquo;t go to him now&mdash;would
      to Heaven I could!&mdash;but neither can I go on living this present life
      any longer. So I am turning my back on it all, exactly as I said I would&mdash;the
      world, so sweet and so cruel; art, so beautiful and so difficult, and even
      &lsquo;the clapping of hands in a theatre.&rsquo; You will say I am a donkey, and so I
      may be, but it must be a descendant of Balaam&rsquo;s old friend, who knew the
      way she ought to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me that I am going without saying good-bye. It is enough to have
      to resist the battering of one&rsquo;s own doubts without encountering your dear
      solicitations. And forgive me that I am not telling you where I am going
      and what is to become of me. You will be questioned and examined, and I
      feel as much frightened of being overtaken by my old existence as the poor
      simpleton who took it into his head that he was a grain of barley, and as
      often as he saw a cock or a hen he ran for his life. Thank you, dearest,
      for allowing me to share your sweet rooms with you, for the bright hours
      we have spent in them, and all the merry jaunts we have had together.
      There will be fewer creature comforts where I am going to, and my feet
      will not be so quick to do evil, which will at least be a saving of
      shoe-leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, old girl&mdash;loyal, unselfish, devoted friend! God will
      reward you yet, and a good man who has been chasing a Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp
      will open his eyes to see that all the time the star of the morning has
      been by his side. Tomorrow, when I leave the house, I know I shall want to
      run up and kiss you as you lie asleep, but I mustn&rsquo;t do that&mdash;the
      little druggeted stairs to your room would be like the road to another but
      not a better place, which is also paved with good intentions. What a
      scatter-brain I am! My heart is breaking, too, with all this severing of
      my poor little riven cords. Your foolish old chummie (the last of her),
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, almost as soon as it was light, she rose and drew a little
      tin box from under the bed. It was the box that had brought all her
      belongings to London when she first came from her island home. Out of this
      box she took a simple gray costume&mdash;the costume she had bought for
      outdoor wear when a nurse at the hospital. Putting it on, she looked at
      herself in the glass. The plain gray figure, so unlike what she had been
      the night before, sent a little stab to her heart, and she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is Glory, after all,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;This is the granddaughter of
      my grandfather, the daughter of my father, and not the visionary woman who
      has been masquerading in London so long.&rdquo; But the conceit did not comfort
      her very much, and scalding tear-drops began to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tying up some other clothing into a little bundle, she opened the door and
      listened. There was no noise in the house, and she crept downstairs with a
      light tread. At the drawing-room she paused and took one last look round
      at the place where she had spent so many exciting hours, and lived through
      such various phases of life. While she stood on the threshold there was a
      sound of heavy breathing. It came from the pug, which lay coiled up on the
      sofa, asleep. Reproaching herself with having forgotten the little thing,
      she took it up in her arms and hushed it when it awoke and began to whine.
      Then she crept down to the front door, opened it softly, passed out, and
      closed it after her. There was a click of the lock in the silent gardens,
      and then no sound anywhere but the chirrup of the sparrows in the eaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was beginning to climb over the cool and quiet streets as she went
      along, and some cabmen at the stand looked over at the woman in nurse&rsquo;s
      dress, with a little bundle in one hand and the dog under the other arm.
      &ldquo;Been to a death, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps. Some uv these nurses, they&rsquo;ve tender &lsquo;earts,
      bless &lsquo;em, and when I was in the &lsquo;awspital&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But she turned
      her head and hurried on, and the voice was lost in the empty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she dipped into the slums of Westminster the sun gleamed on her wet
      face, and a group of noisy, happy girls, going to their work in the jam
      factories of Soho, came toward her laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked at the Sister as she passed; their tongues stopped, and
      there was a hush.

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Storm&rsquo;s enemies had succeeded. He was committed for sedition, and
      there was the probability that when brought up again he would be charged
      with complicity in manslaughter. Throughout the proceedings at the police
      court he maintained a calm and dignified silence. Supported by an exalted
      faith, he regarded even death with composure. When the trial was over and
      the policeman who stood at the back of the dock tapped him on the arm, he
      started like a man whose mind had been occupied by other issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the policeman, and he was taken back to the cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he was removed to Holloway, and there he observed the same calm
      and silent attitude. His bearing touched and impressed the authorities,
      and they tried by various small kindnesses to make his imprisonment easy.
      He encouraged them but little.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second morning an officer came to his cell and said, &ldquo;Perhaps you
      would care to look at the newspaper, Father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The newspapers were never much to me even
      when I was living in the world&mdash;they can not be necessary now that I
      am going out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, you exaggerate your danger. Besides, now that the papers
      contain so much about yourself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a reason why I should not see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, Father, this morning&rsquo;s paper has something
      about somebody else, and that was why I brought it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody near to you&mdash;very near and&mdash;&mdash; But I&rsquo;ll leave it
      with you&mdash;&mdash;Nothing to complain of this morning&mdash;no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John Storm was already deep in the columns of the newspaper. He found
      the news intended for him. It was the death of his father. The paragraph
      was cruel and merciless. &ldquo;Thus the unhappy man who was brought up at Bow
      Street two days ago is now a peer in his own right and the immediate heir
      to an earldom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment was a bitter and terrible one. Memories of past years swept
      over him&mdash;half-forgotten incidents of his boyhood when his father was
      his only friend and he walked with his hand in his&mdash;memories of his
      father&rsquo;s love for him, his hopes, his aims, his ambitions, and all the
      vast ado of his poor delusive dreams. And then came thoughts of the broken
      old man dying alone, and of himself in his prison cell. It had been a
      strangely familiar thought to him of late that if he left London at seven
      in the morning he could speak to his father at seven the same night. And
      now his father was gone, the last opportunity was lost, and he could speak
      to him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he tried to conquer the call of blood which he had put aside so long,
      and to set over against it the claims of his exalted mission and the
      spirit of the teaching of Christ. What had Christ said? &ldquo;Call no man your
      father upon the earth; for one is your Father which is in heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;&lsquo;for one is your Father which is in
      heaven.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he took up the newspaper again, thinking to read with a calmer mind
      the report of his father&rsquo;s death and burial, but his eye fell on a
      different matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.&mdash;Hardly has the public mind
      recovered from the perplexity attending the disappearance of a well-known
      clergyman from Westminster, when the news comes of a no less mysterious
      disappearance of a popular actress from a West-End theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Glory!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although a recent acquisition to the stage and the latest English actress
      to come into her heritage of fame, she was already a universal favourite,
      and her sudden and unaccountable disappearance is a shock as well as a
      surprise. To the disappointment of the public she had not played her part
      for nearly a week, having excused herself on the ground of indisposition,
      but there was apparently nothing in the state of her health to give cause
      for anxiety or to prepare her friends for the step she has taken. What has
      become of her appears to be entirely beyond conjecture, but her colleagues
      and associates are still hoping for the hest, though the tone of a letter
      left behind gives only too much reason to fear a sad and perhaps fatal
      sequel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the officer entered the cell again an hour after his first visit,
      John Storm was pallid and thin and gray. The sublime faith he had built up
      for himself had fallen to ruins, a cloud had hidden the face of the Father
      which was in heaven, and the death he had waited for as the crown of his
      life seemed to be no better than an abject end to a career that had
      failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; said the officer; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve some good news for you, at all
      events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner smiled sadly and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bail was offered and accepted at Bow Street this morning, and you will be
      at liberty to leave us to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; said John, and his manner changed immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not just yet, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the love of God, sir, let me go at once! I have something to
      do-somebody to look for and find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, for your own security, Father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know that the mob sent a dog out in search of you 2&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know that; but if all the dogs of Christendom&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are worse dogs waiting for you than any that go on four legs, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing, sir, nothing at all; and if bail has been accepted,
      surely it is your duty to liberate me at once. I claim&mdash;I demand that
      you should do so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer raised his eyes in astonishment. &ldquo;You surprise me, Father.
      After your calmness and patience and submission to authority too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm remained silent for a moment, and then he said, with a touching
      solemnity: &ldquo;You must forgive me, sir. You are very good&mdash;everybody is
      good to me here. Still, I am not afraid, and if you can let me go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer left him. It was several hours before he returned. By this
      time the long summer day had closed in, and it was quite dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They think you&rsquo;ve gone. You can leave now. Come this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the office some minutes afterward John Storm paused with
      the officer&rsquo;s hand in his, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is needless to ask who is my bail&rdquo; (he was thinking of Mrs.
      Callender), &ldquo;but if you can tell me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. It was Sir Francis Drake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm bowed gravely and turned away. As he passed out of the yard his
      eyes were bent on the ground and his step was slow and feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Drake was on his way to the Corinthian Club. Early in the
      afternoon he had seen this letter in the columns of an evening paper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mysterious Disappearances.&mdash;Is it not extraordinary that in
      discussing &lsquo;the epidemic of mystery&rsquo; which now fills the air of London it
      has apparently never occurred to any one that the two mysterious
      disappearances which are the text of so many sermons may be really one
      disappearance only, that the &lsquo;man of God&rsquo; and the &lsquo;woman of the theatre&rsquo; 
      may have acted in collusion, from the same impulse and with the same
      expectation, and that the rich and beneficent person who (according to the
      latest report) has come to the rescue of the one, and is an active agent
      in looking for the other, is in reality the foolish though well-meaning
      victim of both?&mdash;R. U.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For three hours Drake had searched for Lord Robert with flame in his eyes
      and fury in his looks. Going first to Belgrave Square, he had found the
      blinds down and the house shut up. Mrs. Macrae was dead. She had died at a
      lodging in the country, alone and unattended. Her wealth had not been able
      to buy the devotion of one faithful servant at the end. She had left
      nothing to her daughter except a remonstrance against her behaviour, but
      she had made Lord Robert her chief heir and sole executor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That amiable mourner had returned to London with all possible despatch as
      soon as the breath was out of his mother-in-law&rsquo;s body and arrangements
      were made for its transit. He was now engaged in relieving the tension of
      so much unusual emotion by a round of his nightly pleasures. Drake had
      come up with him at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Corinthian Club was unusually gay that night, &ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; came from
      every side. The music in the ballroom was louder than ever, and, judging
      by the numbers of the dancers, the attraction of &ldquo;Tra-la-la&rdquo; was even
      greater than before. There was the note of yet more reckless license
      everywhere, as if that little world whose life was pleasure had been under
      the cloud of a temporary terror and was determined to make up for it by
      the wildest folly. The men chaffed and laughed and shouted comic songs and
      kicked their legs about; the women drank and giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert was in the supper-room with three guests&mdash;the &ldquo;three
      graces.&rdquo; The women were in full evening dress. Betty was wearing the ring
      she had taken from Polly &ldquo;just to remember her by, pore thing,&rdquo; and the
      others were blazing in similar brilliants. The wretched man himself was
      half drunk. He had been talking of Father Storm and of his own wife in a
      jaunty tone, behind which there was an intensity of hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this panic of his, don&rsquo;t you know, was the funniest thing ever heard
      of. Going home that night I counted seventeen people on their knees in the
      streets&mdash;&lsquo;pon my soul I did! Eleven old women of eighty, two or three
      of seventy, and one or two that might be as young as sixty-nine. Then the
      epidemic of piety in high life too! Several of our millionaires gave
      sixpence apiece to beggars&mdash;were seen to do it, don&rsquo;t you know. One
      old girl gave up playing baccarat and subscribed to &lsquo;Darkest England.&rsquo; No
      end of sweet little women confessed their pretty weaknesses to their
      husbands, and now that the world is wagging along as merrily as before,
      they don&rsquo;t know what the devil they are to do&mdash;&mdash; But look
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of his trousers pockets at either side he tugged a torn and crumpled
      assortment of letters and proceeded to tumble them on to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are a few of the applications I had from curates-in-charge and such
      beauties for the care of the living in Westminster while the other
      gentleman lay in jail. It&rsquo;s the Bishop&rsquo;s right to appoint the creature,
      don&rsquo;t you know, but they think a patron&rsquo;s recommendation&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
      they&rsquo;re a sweet team! Listen to this: &lsquo;May it please your lordship&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then in mock tones, flourishing one hand, the man read aloud amid the
      various noises of the place&mdash;the pop of champagne bottles and the
      rumble of the dancing in the room below&mdash;the fulsome letters he had
      received from clergymen. The wretched women in their paint and patches
      shrieked with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at that moment Drake came up, looking pale and fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello there! Is it you? Sit down and take a glass of fizz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at this table,&rdquo; said Drake. &ldquo;I prefer to drink with friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert&rsquo;s eyes glistened, and he tried to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Thought I was counted in that distinguished company, don&rsquo;t you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were, but I&rsquo;ve come to see that a friend who is not a friend is
      always the worst enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; said Drake, throwing the paper on to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The initials to that letter are yours, and all the men I meet tell me
      that you have written it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do, do they? Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask you if you did or if you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, dear boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll require you to disown it, publicly and at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I won&rsquo;t&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell the public for myself that it&rsquo;s a lie, a cowardly and
      contemptible lie, and that the man who wrote it is a cur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! So it&rsquo;s like that, is it?&rdquo; said Lord Robert, rising to his feet as
      if putting himself on guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it <i>is</i> like that, Lord Robert Ure, because the woman who is
      slandered in that letter is as innocent as your own wife, and ten thousand
      times as pure as those who are your constant company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Robert&rsquo;s angular and ugly face glistened with a hateful smile.
      &ldquo;Innocent!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, and then he laughed out aloud. &ldquo;Go on! It&rsquo;s
      rippin&rsquo; to hear you, dear boy! Innocent, by God! Just as innocent as any
      other ballet girl who is dragged through the stews of London, and then
      picked up at last by the born fool who keeps her for another man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You liar!&rdquo; cried Drake, and like a flash of light he had shot his fist
      across the table and struck the man full in the face. Then laying hold of
      the table itself, he swept it away with all that was on it, and sprang at
      Lord Robert and took him by the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that back, will you? Take it back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Lord Robert, writhing and struggling in his grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take that&mdash;and that&mdash;and that&mdash;damn you!&rdquo; cried
      Drake, showering blow after blow, and finally flinging the man into the <i>débris</i>
      of what had fallen from the table with a crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women were screaming by this time and all the house was in alarm. But
      Drake went out with long strides and a ferocious face, and no one
      attempted to stop him.

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Returning to St. James&rsquo;s Street, Drake found John Storm waiting in his
      rooms. The men had changed a good deal since they last met, and the faces
      of both showed suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for this visit,&rdquo; said Storm. &ldquo;It was my first duty to call and
      thank you for what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;nothing at all,&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had also another object. You&rsquo;ll know what that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is gone, it seems, and there is no trace left of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then <i>you</i> know nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake bowed his head again. &ldquo;I knew it was a lie&mdash;that she had gone
      after you&mdash;I never believed that story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God she had!&rdquo; said Storm fervently, and Drake flinched, but bore
      himself bravely. &ldquo;When did she go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two days ago, apparently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anybody looked for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> have&mdash;everywhere&mdash;everywhere I can think of. But this
      London&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I know&mdash;I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two days I have never rested, and all last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Storm&rsquo;s eyes were watching the twitchings of Drake&rsquo;s face. He had been
      sitting uneasily on his chair, and now he rose from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going already?&rdquo; said Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Storm. Then in a husky voice he added: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if we
      shall ever meet again, you and I. When death breaks the link that binds
      people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it <i>is</i> so, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows! Certainly the letter she left behind&mdash;the letter to
      Rosa&mdash;&mdash; Poor child, she was such a creature of joy&mdash;so
      bright, so brilliant! And then to think of her&mdash;&mdash; I was much to
      blame&mdash;I came between you. But if I had once realized&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake stopped, and the men fixed their eyes on each other for a moment,
      and then turned their heads away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve done you a great injustice, sir,&rdquo; said Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought she was only your toy, your plaything. But perhaps&rdquo; (his voice
      was breaking)&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps you loved her too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake answered, almost inaudibly, &ldquo;With all my heart and soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then we have <i>both</i> lost her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment. The hands of the two men met and clasped
      and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; said Storm, and he moved across the room with a look of utter
      weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are you going to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;anywhere&mdash;nowhere&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drake stood at the door below until the slow, uncertain footsteps had
      turned the corner of the street and died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was sure now. Overwhelmed by his own disgrace, ashamed of his
      downfall, and perhaps with a sense of her own share in it, Glory had
      destroyed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange contradiction! Much as he had hated Glory&rsquo;s way of life, there
      came to him at the moment a deep remorse at the thought that he had been
      the means of putting an end to it. And then her gay and happy spirit
      clouded by his own disasters! Her good name stained by association with
      his evil one! Her pure soul imperilled by his sin and fall!
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was now very late and he began to ask himself where he was to
      sleep. At first he thought of his old quarters under the church, and then
      he told himself that Brother Andrew would be gone by this time, and that
      everything connected with the parish must be transferred to other keeping.
      Going by a hotel in Trafalgar Square he stepped in and asked for a bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk, who was polite and deferential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I have something to eat, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee-room to the left, sir. Luggage coming, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no luggage to-night,&rdquo; he answered, and then he saw that the clerk
      looked at him doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coffee-room was empty and only half lit up, for dinner was long over
      and the business of the day was done. John was sitting at his meal, eating
      his food with his eyes down and hardly conscious of what was going on
      around, when he became aware that from time to time people opened the room
      door and looked across at him, then whispered together and passed out. At
      length the clerk came up to him with awkward manners and a look of
      constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but&mdash;are you Father Storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John bent his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m sorry to say we can not accommodate you&mdash;we dare not&mdash;we
      must request you to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John rose without a word, paid his bill, and left the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was he to go to? What house would receive him? If one hotel
      refused him, all other hotels in London would do the same. Then he
      remembered the shelter which he had himself established for the
      undeserving poor. The humiliation of that moment was terrible. But no
      matter! He would drink the cup of God&rsquo;s anger to the dregs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was burning in the clock tower of the Houses of Parliament, and
      as John passed by the corner of Palace Yard two Bishops came out in
      earnest conversation, and walked on in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The State and the Church are as the body and soul,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;and to
      separate them would be death to both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and therefore we must fight for the Church&rsquo;s
      temporal possessions as we should contend for her spiritual rights; and so
      these Benefice Bills&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shelter was at the point of closing, and Jupe was putting out the lamp
      over the door as John stepped up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; said Jupe in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, Jupe?&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Jawn Storm!&rdquo; cried the man in a whisper of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want shelter for the night, Jupe. Can you put me up anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was staggered and the long rod in his hand shook like a reed. Then
      he began to stammer something about the Bishop and the Archdeacon and his
      new orders and instructions&mdash;how the shelter had been taken over by
      other authorities, and he was now&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But d&mdash;- it all!&rdquo; he said, stopping suddenly, putting his foot down
      firmly, and wagging his head to right and left like a man making a brave
      resolution, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tyke ye in, sir, and heng it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the bitterest pill of all, but John swallowed it, and stepped into
      the house. As he did so he was partly aware of some tumult in a
      neighbouring street, with the screaming of men and women and the barking
      of dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blankets had been served out for the night and the men in the shelter
      were clambering up to their bunks. In addition to the main apartment there
      was a little room with a glass front which hung like a cage near to the
      ceiling at one end and was entered by a circular iron stair. This was the
      keeper&rsquo;s own sleeping place, and Jupe was making it ready for John, while
      John himself sat waiting with the look of a crushed and humiliated man,
      when the tumult in the street came nearer and at last drew up in front of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s thet?&rdquo; the men asked each other, lifting their heads, and Jupe came
      down and went to the door. When he returned his face was white, the sweat
      hung on his forehead, and a trembling shook his whole body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Gawd&rsquo;s sake, Father, leave the house at onct!&rdquo; he whispered in great
      agitation. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gang outside as&rsquo;ll pull the place dahn if I keep
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, save for the shouting outside, and then
      John said, with a sigh and a look of resignation, &ldquo;Very well, let me out,
      then,&rdquo; and he turned to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that wy, sir&mdash;this wy,&rdquo; said Jupe, and at the next moment they
      were stepping into a dark and narrow lane at the back. &ldquo;Turn to the left
      when ye get ter the bottom, Father&mdash;mind ye turn ter the left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John Storm had scarcely heard him. His heart had failed him at last.
      He saw the baseness and ingratitude of the people whom he had spent
      himself to relieve and uplift and succour and comfort, and he repented
      himself of the hopes and aims and efforts which had come to this
      bankruptcy in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, that was it! It was not this poor vile race merely, this stupid
      and ungrateful humanity&mdash;it was God! God used one man&rsquo;s ignorance,
      and another man&rsquo;s anger, and another man&rsquo;s hatred, and another man&rsquo;s
      spite, and worked out his own ends through it all. And God had rejected
      him, refused him, turned a deaf ear to his prayer and his repentance,
      robbed him of friends, of affection, of love, and cast him out of the
      family of man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well! So be it! What should he do? He would go back to prison and
      say: &ldquo;Take me in again&mdash;there is no room left for me in the world. I
      am alone, and my heart is dead within me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was at the end of the dark lane by this time, and forgetting Jupe&rsquo;s
      warning, and seeing a brightly lighted street running off to his right, he
      swung round to it and walked boldly along. This was Old Pye Street, and he
      had come to the corner at which it opens into Brown&rsquo;s Square when his
      absent mind became conscious of the loud baying of a dog. At the next
      moment the dog was at his feet, bounding about him with frantic delight,
      leaping up to him as if trying to kiss him, and uttering meanwhile the
      most tender, the most true, the most pitiful cries of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his own dog, the bloodhound Don!
    </p>
    <p>
      His unworthy thoughts were, chased away at the sight of this one faithful
      friend remaining, and he was stooping to fondle the great creature, to
      pull at the long drapery of its ears and the pendulous folds of its
      glorious forehead, when a short, sharp cry caused him to lift his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s &lsquo;im!&rdquo; said somebody, and then he was aware that a group of men
      with evil faces had gathered round. He knew them in a moment: the publican
      with his bandaged head, Sharkey, who had served his time and been released
      from prison, and Pincher and Hawkins, who were out on bail. They had all
      been drinking. The publican, who carried a stick, was drunk, and the
      &ldquo;knocker-up&rdquo; was staggering on a crutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a hideous scene. The four men began to taunt John Storm, to take
      off their hats and bow to him in mock honour. &ldquo;His Lordship, I believe &lsquo;&rdquo;
       said one. &ldquo;His Reverend Lordship, if you please!&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me; for God&rsquo;s sake, leave me!&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their taunts became more and more menacing. &ldquo;Wot abart the end uv the
      world, Father?&rdquo; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ye tell me to sell my bit uv biziness?&rdquo; &ldquo;And
      didn&rsquo;t ye say you&rsquo;d cured me? and look at me now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, I tell you, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried John, and he moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed and began to push him. Then he stopped and cried in a loud
      voice of struggle and agony: &ldquo;Do you want to raise the devil in me? Go
      home! Go home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they only laughed and renewed their torment. His hat fell off and he
      snatched at it to recover it. In doing so his hand struck somebody in the
      face. &ldquo;Strike a cripple, will ye?&rdquo; said the publican, and he raised his
      stick and struck a heavy blow on John&rsquo;s shoulder. At the next moment the
      dog had leaped upon the man, and he was shrieking on the ground. The
      &ldquo;knocker-up&rdquo; lifted his crutch and with the upper end of it he battered at
      the dog&rsquo;s brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, man! stop, stop!&mdash;Don! Don!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the dog held on, and the man with the crutch continued to strike at
      it, until Pincher, who had run to the other side of the street, came back
      with a clasp knife and plunged it into the dog&rsquo;s neck. Then with a growl
      and a whine and a pitiful cry the creature let go its hold and rolled
      over, and the publican got on to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of the end. John Storm looked down at the dog in its
      death-throes, and all the devil in his heart came up and mastered him.
      There was a shop at the corner of the square, and some heavy chairs were
      standing on the pavement. He took up one of these and swung it round him
      like a toy, and the men fell on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the street was in commotion, and people were coming from
      every court and yard and alley crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A madman!&rdquo; &ldquo;Police!&rdquo; &ldquo;Lay hold of him!&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill somebody!&rdquo; &ldquo;Down with
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Storm was also shouting at the top of his voice, when suddenly he
      felt a dull, stunning pain, without exactly knowing where. Then he felt
      himself moving up, up, up&mdash;he was in a train, the train was going
      through a tunnel, and the guards were screaming; then it was hot and at
      the next moment it was cold, and still he was floating, floating; and then
      he saw Glory&mdash;he heard her say something&mdash;and then he opened his
      eyes, and lo! the dark sky was above him, and some women were speaking in
      agitated voices over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Father Storm. The brutes! The beasts! And the pore dog, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! Where&rsquo;s the p&rsquo;lice? What are we goin&rsquo; to do with &lsquo;im, Aggie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tyke &lsquo;im to my room, thet&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard Big Ben strike twelve, and then&mdash;&mdash; It was a long,
      long journey, and the tunnel seemed to go on and on.

      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterward there came to the door of the Orphanage the single
      loud thud that is the knock of the poor. An upper window was opened, and a
      tremulous voice from the street below cried, &ldquo;Glory! Miss Gloria!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Agatha Jones. Glory hastened downstairs and found the girl in great
      agitation. One glance at her face in the candlelight seemed to tell all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s hurt. He&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be calm, child; tell me everything,&rdquo; said Glory, and Aggie delivered her
      message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since leaving Holloway, Father Storm had been followed and found by means
      of the dog. The crowd had set on him and knocked him down and injured him.
      He was now lying in Aggie&rsquo;s room. There had been nowhere else to take him
      to, for the men had disappeared the moment he was down, and the women were
      afraid to take him in. The police had come at last and they were now gone
      for the parish doctor. Mrs. Pincher was with the Father, and the poor dog
      was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory held her hand over her heart while Aggie told her story. &ldquo;I follow
      you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did you tell him I was here? Did he send you to fetch
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he unconscious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hurrying across the streets by Glory&rsquo;s side, Aggie apologized for her room
      again. &ldquo;I down&rsquo;t live thet wy now, you know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It may seem
      strange to you, but while my little boy was alive I couldn&rsquo;t go into the
      streets to save my life&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t do it. And when &lsquo;is pore father
      died lahst week&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stone stairs to the tenement house were thronged with women. They
      stood huddled together in groups like sheep in a storm. There was not a
      man anywhere visible, except a drunken sailor, who was coming down from an
      upper story whistling and singing. The women silenced him. Had he no
      feelings?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor&rsquo;s came, Sister,&rdquo; said a woman standing by Aggie&rsquo;s door. Then
      Glory entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor disordered place was lit by a cheap lamp, which threw splashes of
      light and left tracts of shadow. John lay on the bed, muttering words that
      were inaudible. His coat and waistcoat had been removed, and his shirt was
      open at the neck. The high wall of his forehead was marble white, but his
      cheeks were red and feverish. One of his arms lay over the side of the bed
      and Glory took it up and held it. Her great eyes were moist, but she did
      not cry, neither did she speak or move. The doctor was bathing a wound at
      the back of the head, and he looked up and nodded as Glory entered. At the
      other side of the bed an elderly woman in a widow&rsquo;s cap was wiping her
      eyes with her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor was going away, Glory followed him to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he seriously injured, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very.&rdquo; The doctor was a young man&mdash;quick, brusque, and emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dange&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The brutes have done for him, nurse, though you needn&rsquo;t tell his
      friends so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;there is&mdash;no chance&mdash;whatever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a ghost of a chance. By the way, you might try to find out where his
      friends are, and send a line to them. I&rsquo;ll be here in the morning.
      Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory staggered back to the room, with her hand pressed hard over her
      heart, and the young doctor, going downstairs two steps at a stride, met a
      police sergeant and a reporter coming up. &ldquo;Cruel business, sir!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, but
      just one of those things that can&rsquo;t easily be brought home to anybody.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Sad, though!&rdquo; &ldquo;Very sad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The short night seemed as if it would never end. When daylight came the
      cheerless place was cleared of its refuse&mdash;its withered roses, its
      cigarette ends and its heaps of left-off clothing. Toward eight o&rsquo;clock
      Glory hurried back to the Orphanage, leaving Aggie and Mrs. Pincher in
      charge. John had been muttering the whole night, through, but he had never
      once moved and he was still unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little faces, fresh and bright from sleep, were waiting for their
      breakfast. When the meal was over Glory wrote by express to Mrs. Callender
      and to the Father Superior of the Brotherhood, then put on her bonnet and
      cloak and turned toward Downing Street.

      The Prime Minister had held an early Cabinet Council that morning. It was
      observed by his colleagues that he looked depressed and preoccupied. When
      the business of the day was done he rose to his feet rather feebly and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lords and gentlemen, I have long had it in mind to say something&mdash;something
      of importance&mdash;and I feel the impulse to say it now. We have been
      doing our best with legislation affecting the Church, to give due reality
      and true life to its relation with the State. But the longer I live the
      more I feel that that relation is in itself a false one, injurious and
      even dangerous to both alike. Never in history, so far as I know, and
      certainly never within my own experience, has it been possible to maintain
      the union of Church and State without frequent adultery and corruption.
      The effort to do so has resulted in manifest impostures in sacred things,
      in ceremonies without spiritual significance, and in gross travesties of
      the solemn, worship of God. Speaking of our own Church, I will not
      disguise my belief that, but for the good and true men who are always to
      be found within its pale, it could not survive the frequent disregard of
      principles which lie deep in the theory of Christianity. Its epicureanism,
      its regard for the interests of the purse, its tendency to rank the
      administrator above the apostle, are weeds that spring up out of the soil
      of its marriage with the State. And when I think of the anomalies and
      inequalities of its internal government, of its countless poor clergy, and
      of its lords and princes, above all when I remember its apostolic
      pretensions and the certainty that he who attempts to live within the
      Church the real life of the apostles will incur the risk of that martyrdom
      which it has always pronounced against innovators, I can not but believe
      that the consciences of many Churchmen would be glad to be relieved of a
      burden of State temptation which they feel to be hurtful and intolerable&mdash;to
      render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar&rsquo;s and unto God the things
      that are God&rsquo;s. Be that as it may, I have now to tell you that feeling
      this question to be paramount, yet despairing of dealing with it in the
      few years that old age has left to me, I have concluded to resign my
      office. It is for some younger statesman to fight this battle of the
      separation between the spiritual and the temporal in the interests of true
      religion and true civilization. God grant he may be a Christian man, and
      God speed and bless him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cabinet broke up with many unwonted expressions of affection for the
      old leader, and many requests that he should &ldquo;think again&rdquo; over the step
      he contemplated. But every one knew that he had set his heart on an
      impossible enterprise, and every one felt that behind it lay the painful
      impulse of an incident reported at length in the newspapers that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone in the cabinet room, the Prime Minister drew up his chair
      before the empty grate and gave way to tender memories. He thought of John
      Storm and the wreck his life had fallen to; of John&rsquo;s mother and her brave
      renunciation of love; and finally of himself and his near retirement. A
      spasm of the old lust of power came over him, and he saw himself&mdash;to-morrow,
      next day, next week&mdash;delivering up his seals of office to the Queen,
      and then&mdash;the next day after that&mdash;getting up from this chair
      for the last time and going out of this room to return to it no more&mdash;his
      work done, his life ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at that moment the footman came to say that a young lady in the
      dress of a nurse was waiting in the hall. &ldquo;A messenger from John,&rdquo; he
      thought. And, as he rose to receive her, heavily, wearily, and with the
      burden of his years upon him, Glory came into the room with her quivering
      face and two great tear-drops standing in her eyes, but glowing with youth
      and health and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sit down. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; looking at her again, &ldquo;have you
      been here before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen you somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was an actress once. And I am a friend of John&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of John&rsquo;s? Then you are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory! And so we meet at last, dear lady! But I <i>have</i> seen you
      before. When he spoke of you, but did not bring you to see me, I took a
      stolen glance at the theatre myself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left it, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she told him what she had done. His old eyes glistened and his
      head sank into his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that I came to talk about, my lord, but another and more
      painful matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I relieve you of the burden of your message, my child? It has reached
      me already. It is in all the morning newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that. Still the doctor told me to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the doctor say about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says we are going to lose him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent for a great surgeon&mdash;But no doubt it is past help. Poor
      boy! It seems only yesterday he came up to London so full of hope and
      expectation. I can see him now with his great eyes, sitting in that chair
      you occupy, talking of his plans and purposes. Poor John! To think he
      should come to this! But these tumultuous souls whose hearts are
      battlefields, when the battle is over what can be left but a waste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory&rsquo;s eyes had dried of themselves and she was looking at the old man
      with an expression of pain, but he went on without observing her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one of the dark riddles of the inscrutable Power which rules over
      life that the good man can go under like that, while the evil one lives
      and prospers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and walked to and fro before the fireplace. &ldquo;Ah, well! The years
      bring me an ever-deepening sadness, an ever-increasing sense of our
      impotence to diminish, the infinite sorrow of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked down at Glory and said: &ldquo;But I can hardly forgive him that
      he has thrown away so much for so little. And when I think of you, my
      child, and of all that might have been, and then of the bad end he has
      come to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t call it coming to a bad end, sir,&rdquo; said Glory in a quivering
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? To be torn and buffeted and trampled down in the streets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it? He might have died of old age in his bed and yet come to a
      worse end than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is coming to a bad end I shall have to believe that my father,
      who was a missionary, came to a bad end too when he was killed by the
      fevers of Africa. Every martyr comes to a bad end if that is a bad ending.
      And so does everybody who is brave and true and does good to humanity and
      is willing to die for it. But it isn&rsquo;t bad. It&rsquo;s glorious! I would rather
      be the daughter of a man who died like that than be the daughter of an
      earl, and if I could have been the wife of one who was torn and trampled
      down, in the streets by the very people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her face, which had been aflame, broke into tears again and her voice
      failed her. The old man could not speak, and there was silence for a
      moment. Then she recovered herself and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to ask you if you could do something for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have heard that John wished me to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God you had done so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was when everybody was praising him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody is abusing him now, and railing at him and insulting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to marry him at last if there is a way&mdash;if you think it is
      possible and can be managed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you say he is a dying man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why! When he comes to himself he will be thinking as you think,
      that his life has been a failure, and I want somebody to be there and say:
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t, it is only beginning, it is the grain of mustard seed that <i>must</i>
      die, but it will live in the heart of humanity for ages and ages to come;
      and I would rather take up your name, injured and insulted as it is, than
      win all the glory the world has in it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears were coursing down the old man&rsquo;s face, and for some minutes he
      did not attempt to speak. Then he said:

    <p>
      &ldquo;What you propose is quite possible. It will be a canonical marriage, but
      it will take some little time to arrange. I must send across to Lambeth
      Palace. Toward evening I can go down to where he lies and take the license
      with me. Meantime speak to a clergyman and have everything in readiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked with Glory down the long corridor to the door, and there he
      kissed her on the forehead and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long known that a woman can be brave, but meeting you this morning
      has taught me something else, my child. Time and again I thought John&rsquo;s
      love of you was near to madness. He was ready to give up everything for it&mdash;everything!
      And he was right! Love like yours is the pearl of pearls, and he who wins
      it is a prince of princes!&rdquo;

    <p>
      Later the same day, when the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his room,
      a member of his cabinet brought him an evening paper containing an article
      which was making a deep impression in London. It was understood to be
      written by a journalist of Jewish extraction:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;HIS BLOOD BE ON US AND ON OUR CHILDREN.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This prediction has been for eighteen hundred years the expression of an
      historical truth. That the whole Jewish nation, and not Pilate or the
      rabble of Jerusalem, killed Jesus is a fact which every Jew has been made
      to feel down to the present day. But let the Christian nation that is
      without sin toward the Founder of Christianity first cast a stone at the
      Jews. If it is true, as Jesus himself said, that he who offers a cup of
      cold water to the least of his little ones offers it to him, then it is
      also true that he who inflicts torture and death on his followers
      crucifies him afresh. The unhappy man who has been miserably murdered in
      the slums of Westminster was a follower of Jesus if ever there lived one,
      and whosoever the actual persons may be who are guilty of his death, the
      true culprit is the Christian nation which has inflicted mockeries and
      insults on everybody who has dared to stand alone under the ensign of
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us not be led away by sneers. This man, whatever his errors, his
      weaknesses, his self-delusions, and his many human failings, was a
      Christian. He was the prophet of woman in relation to humanity as hardly
      any one since Jesus has ever been. And he is hounded out of life. Thus,
      after nineteen centuries, Christianity presents the same characteristics
      of frightful tyranny which disfigured the old Jewish law. &lsquo;We have a law,
      and by our law he ought to die.&rsquo; Such is the sentence still pronounced on
      reformers in a country where civil and religious laws are confounded. God
      grant the other half of that doom may not also come true&mdash;&lsquo;His blood
      be on us and on our children!&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a crowd of people of all sorts outside the tenement house when
      Glory returned to Brown&rsquo;s Square, and even the stairs were thronged with
      them. &ldquo;The nurse!&rdquo; they whispered as Glory appeared, and they made a way
      for her. Aggie was on the landing, wiping her eyes and answering the
      questions of strangers, being half afraid of the notoriety her poor room
      was achieving and half proud of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The laidy &lsquo;as came, Miss Gloria, and she sent me to tell you to wyte &lsquo;ere
      for &lsquo;er a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then putting her head in at the open doer she beckoned and Mrs. Callender
      came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! He&rsquo;s coming to. The poor laddie! He&rsquo;s been calling for ye, and
      calling and calling. But he thinks ye&rsquo;re in heaven together, seemingly, so
      ye must no say anything to shock him. Come your ways in now, and tak&rsquo; 
      care, lassie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was still wandering, and the light of another world was in his eyes,
      but he was smiling, and he appeared to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he said in the toneless voice of one who talks in his
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here now. Look! She&rsquo;s close beside ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory advanced a step and stood beside the bed, struggling with herself
      not to fall upon his breast. He looked at her with a smile, but without
      any surprise, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that you would come to meet me, Glory! How happy you look! We
      shall both be happy now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his eyes wandered about the poor, ill-furnished apartment, and he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful it is here! And how lightsome the air is! Look! The golden
      gates! And the seven golden candlesticks! And the sea of glass like unto
      crystal! And all the innumerable company of the angels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie, who had returned to the room, was crying audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you crying. Glory? Foolish child to cry! But I know&mdash;I
      understand! Put your dear hand in mine, my child, and we will go together
      to God&rsquo;s throne and say: &lsquo;Father, you must forgive us two. We were but man
      and woman, and we could not help but love each other, though it was a
      fault, and for one of us it was a sin.&rsquo; And God will forgive us, because
      he made us so, and because God is the God of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory could bear no more. &ldquo;John!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised himself on his elbow and held his head aslant, like one who
      listens to a sound that comes from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Glory&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> Glory, dearest.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The serenity in his face gave way to a look of bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Glory is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, she is alive, and she will never leave you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Aggie&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aggie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember Aggie? One of the poor girls you fought and worked
      for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your spirit, Glory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is myself, dearest, my very, very self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a great joy came into his eyes, his breast heaved, his breath came
      quick, and without a word more he stretched out his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Glory! She is alive! My God! O my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you forgive me, Glory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive? There is nothing to forgive you for&mdash;except loving me too
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling! My darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was in heaven, Glory, but I am like poor Buckingham&mdash;only
      half way to it yet. Have I been unconscious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory nodded her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I remember everything now. I was knocked down in the streets, wasn&rsquo;t
      I? The men did it&mdash;Pincher, Hawking, and the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall be punished, John,&rdquo; said Glory in a quivering voice. &ldquo;As sure
      as heaven&rsquo;s above us and there&rsquo;s law in the land&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye, laddie&rdquo; (from somewhere by the door), &ldquo;mak&rsquo; yersel&rsquo; sure o&rsquo; 
      that. There&rsquo;ll be never a man o&rsquo; them but he&rsquo;ll hang for it same as a
      polecat on a barn gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John shook his head. &ldquo;Poor fellows! They didn&rsquo;t understand. When they
      come to see what they&rsquo;ve done&mdash;&mdash; &lsquo;Lord, Lord! lay not this sin
      to their charge.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She had wiped away the tears that sprung to her eyes and was sitting by
      his side and smiling. Her white teeth were showing, her red lips were
      twitching, and her face was full of sunshine. He was holding her hand and
      gazing at her constantly as if he could not allow himself to lose sight of
      her for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m half sorry, for all that, Glory,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we are not both in the other world, for there you were my bride, I
      remember, and all our pains were over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then her sweet face coloured up to the forehead, and she leaned over the
      bed and whispered, &ldquo;Ask me to be your bride in this one, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! I daren&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you thinking of the vows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; emphatically. &ldquo;But&mdash;I am a dying man&mdash;I know that quite
      well. And what right have I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little gay toss of her golden head. &ldquo;Pooh! Nobody was ever
      married because he had a <i>right</i> to be exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is your own profession&mdash;your great career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head gravely. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all over now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; reaching up on his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you had gone and nearly everybody was deserting your work, I thought
      I should like to take up a part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be God! Oh, God is very good!&rdquo; and he lay back and panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed nervously. &ldquo;Well, are you determined to make me ashamed? Am I
      to throw myself at your head, sir? Or perhaps you are going to refuse me,
      after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should I burden all the years of your life with the name of a
      fallen man? I am dying in disgrace, Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but in honour&mdash;great, great honour! These few bad days will be
      forgotten soon, dearest&mdash;quite, quite forgotten. And in the future
      time people will come to me and say&mdash;girls, dearest, brave, brave
      girls, who are fighting the battle of life like men&mdash;they will come
      and say: &lsquo;And did you know him? Did you really, really know him?&rsquo; And I
      will smile triumphantly and answer them &lsquo;Yes, for he loved me, and he is
      mine and I am his forever and forever!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be beautiful! We could not come together in this world; but to
      be united for all eternity on the threshold of the next&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! Say no more about it, for it&rsquo;s all arranged anyhow. The Father has
      been persuaded to read the service, and the Prime Minister is to bring the
      Archbishop&rsquo;s license, and it&rsquo;s to be to-day&mdash;this evening&mdash;and&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;m not the first woman who has settled everything herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she began to laugh, and he laughed with her, and they laughed
      together in spite of his weakness and pain. At the next moment she was
      gone like a gleam of sunshine before a cloud, and Mrs. Callender had come
      back to the bedside, tying up the strings of her old-fashioned bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gold, laddie, that&rsquo;s what yon Glory is&mdash;just gold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, tried in the fire and tested,&rdquo; he replied, and then the back of his
      head began to throb fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory had fled out of the room to cry, and Mrs. Callender joined her on
      the landing. &ldquo;I maun awa&rsquo;, lassie. I&rsquo;d like fine to stop wi&rsquo; ye, but I
      can&rsquo;t. It minds me of the time my Alec left me, and that&rsquo;s forty lang
      years the day, but he seems to have been with me ever syne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Glory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming, Father,&rdquo; said Aggie, and at the sound of her name Glory
      wiped her eyes and returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was it by my being lost that you came here to Westminster and found
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and myself as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought my life had been wasted! When one thinks of God&rsquo;s designs
      one feels humble&mdash;humble as the grass at one&rsquo;s feet&mdash;&mdash;But
      are you sure you will never regret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor look back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head again. &ldquo;Call me Mrs. Lot at once, and have done with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful! What a glorious work is before you, Glory! You&rsquo;ll take it
      up where I have left it, and carry it on and on. You are nobler than I am,
      and stronger, far stronger, and purer and braver. And haven&rsquo;t I said all
      along that what the world wants now is a great woman? I had the pith of it
      all, though I saw the true light&mdash;but I was not worthy. I had sinned
      and fallen, and didn&rsquo;t know my own heart, and was not fit to enter into
      the promised land. It is something, nevertheless, that I see it a long way
      off. And if I have been taken up to Sinai and heard the thunders of the
      everlasting law&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, dear! Somebody is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the great surgeon whom the Prime Minister had sent for. He examined
      the injuries carefully and gave certain instructions. &ldquo;Mind you do this,
      Sister,&rdquo; and that, and the other. But Glory could see that he had no hope.
      To relieve the pain in the head he wanted to administer morphia, but John
      refused to have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going into the presence of the King,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me have all my
      wits about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the doctor was there the police sergeant returned with a magistrate
      and the reporter. &ldquo;Sorry to intrude, but hearing your patient was now
      conscious&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then he prepared to take John&rsquo;s deposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter opened his notebook, the police magistrate stood at the foot
      of the bed, the doctor at one side of it and Glory at the other side,
      holding John&rsquo;s hand and quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who struck you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, and then came &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause, and then, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your own evidence will be most valuable; and, indeed, down to the
      present we have no other. Who is it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not give me the name of the scoundrel who took&mdash;&mdash; I mean
      attempted to take your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then in a voice that was hardly audible, with his head thrown back and his
      eyes on the ceiling, John said, &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they know not
      what they do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to go further. Glory saw the four men to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must keep him quiet,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Not that anything can save
      him, but he is a man of stubborn will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the police magistrate said, &ldquo;It may be all very fine to forgive your
      enemies, but everybody has his duty to society, as well as to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Glory, &ldquo;the world has no room for greater hearts than its
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The police magistrate looked at her in bewilderment. &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; he said,
      and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she now, my girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s &lsquo;ere, Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Glory, coming back to the room. &ldquo;The doctor says you are not
      to talk so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me look at you, Glory. Sit here&mdash;here&mdash;and if I should
      seem to be suffering you must not mind that, because I am really very
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then an organ-man in the street began to play. Glory thought the
      music might disturb John, and she was going to send Aggie to stop it. But
      his face brightened and he said: &ldquo;Sing for me, Glory. Let me hear your
      voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The organ was playing a &ldquo;coon song,&rdquo; and she sang the words of it. They
      were simple words, childish words, almost babyish, but full of tenderness
      and love. The little black boy could think of nothing but his Loo-loo. In
      the night when he was sleeping he awoke and he was weeping, for he was
      always, always dreaming of his Loo-loo, his Loo-loo!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the song was finished they took hands and talked in whispers, though
      they were alone in the room now, and nobody could hear them. His white
      face was very bright, and her moist eyes were full of merriment. They grew
      foolish in their tenderness and played with each other like little
      children. There were recollections of their early life in the little
      island home, memories of years concentrated into an hour&mdash;humorous
      stories and touches of mimicry. &ldquo;&lsquo;O Lord, open thou our lips&mdash;&mdash;Where
      are you, Neilus?&rsquo; &lsquo;Aw, here I am, your riverence, and my tongue shall shew
      forth thy praise.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once John&rsquo;s face saddened and he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the man who carries the flag always gets &lsquo;potted,&rsquo; as they say.
      But somebody must carry it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glory felt her tears gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that I have to go before you, Glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head to keep the tears from flowing, and then answered
      gaily: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only as it should be. I want a little while to think it
      all out, you know, and then&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll pass over to you, just as we
      fall asleep at night and pass from day to day.&rdquo;

    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />

      And then he lay back with a sigh and said, &ldquo;Well, I have had a happy end,
      at all events.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day had been fine, with a rather fierce sun shining until late in the
      afternoon, and long white clouds lying motionless in a deep blue sky, like
      celestial sand-banks in a celestial sea. But the tender and tempered
      splendour of the evening had come at length, with the sun gone over the
      housetops to the northwest, and its solemn afterglow spreading round, like
      the wings of angels sweeping down. London was unusually quiet after the
      roar and turmoil of the day. The great city lay like a tired ocean. And
      like an ocean it seemed to sleep, full of its living as well as its dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little square which stands on the fringe of the slums of Westminster,
      and has a well-worn church in the middle, and tenement houses,
      institutions, and workshops around its sides, a strange crowd had
      gathered. It consisted for the greater part of persons who are generally
      thought to be beyond the sympathies of life&mdash;the &ldquo;priestesses of
      society,&rdquo; who are the lowest among women. But they stood there for hours
      in silence, or walked about with dazed looks, glancing up at the window of
      a room on the second story which glittered with the rays of the dying day.
      Their friend and champion was near to his death in that room, and they
      were waiting for the last news of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister had kept his promise. Walking across from Downing
      Street his face had been clouded, as if he was thinking out the riddles of
      the inscrutable Power which stood to him for God. But when he came to the
      square, and looked round at the people, his eyes brightened and he went on
      with resignation and even content. The women made way for him with
      whispered explanations of who he was, and he walked through them to the
      room upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was nearly full already, for the Father Superior had come,
      bringing lay brother Andrew along with him, and Aggie was sitting in a
      corner, and Mrs. Pincher was moving about, and there was also a stranger
      present. And though the little place was so mean and poor, it was full of
      soft radiance from the sky, and people walked about in it with a glow upon
      their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glory was by the bedside, standing erect and saying nothing. Her eyes were
      glistening with unshed tears, and sometimes her mouth was twitching. John
      Storm was conscious and very quiet. Holding Glory&rsquo;s hand as if he could
      not part with it, he was looking around with the expression of the soldier
      who has done the fearful, perhaps the foolish and foolhardy thing and
      scaled the walls of the enemy. He is lying with the enemy&rsquo;s shot in his
      breast now, and with death in his eyes, but he is smiling proudly for all
      that, because he knows that the army is coming on. The Superior had
      brought from the Brotherhood the picture of the head of Christ in its
      crown of thorns to hang on the wall at the end of the bed, and the light
      from the window made flickering gleams on the glass, and they were
      reflected on to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly anybody spoke. As soon as the Prime Minister arrived he took a
      paper from his pocket and gave it to the stranger, who glanced at it and
      bowed. Then they all gathered about the bed, and the Superior opened a
      book which he had carried in his hands, and in solemn accents began to
      read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the sight of God&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother Andrew, who was kneeling at the foot of the bed, whined like a
      dog, and some women on the landing, who were peering in at the open door,
      whispered among themselves: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Holy Communion! Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s power did not fail him. He made his responses in a clear voice,
      although his last strength was thrilling along the thread of life. And
      Glory, when her turn came, was brave, too. There was just a touch of the
      old hoarseness in her glorious voice, a slight quivering of the lids of
      her glistening eyes, and then she went on to the end without faltering.

      <i>AUTHOR&rsquo;S NOTE</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>It will be seen that in writing this book I have sometimes used the
      diaries, letters, memoirs, sermons, and speeches of recognisable persons,
      living and dead. Also, it will be seen that I have frequently employed
      fact for the purposes of fiction. In doing so, I think I am true to the
      principles of art, and I know I am following the precedent of great
      writers. But being conscious of the grievous: danger of giving personal
      offence, I would wish to say that I have not intended to paint anybody&rsquo;s
      portrait, or to describe the life of any known Society or to indicate the
      management of any particular Institution. To do any of these things would
      be to wrong the theory of fiction as I understand it, which is not to
      offer mock history or a substitute for fact, but to present a thought in
      the form of a story, with as much realism as the requirements of idealism
      will permit. In presenting the thought which is the motive of &ldquo;The
      Christian&rdquo; my desire has been to depict, however imperfectly, the types of
      mind and character, of creed and culture, of social effort and religious
      purpose which I think I see in the life of England and America at the
      close of the nineteenth century. For such a task my own observation and
      reflection could not be enough, and so I am conscious that in many
      passages of this book I have often been merely as the mould through which
      the metal has passed from the fires kept burning round about.</i>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
